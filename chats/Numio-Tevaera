right, give us one second. Looks like there's a little bit of
technical difficulties going on here. I should just take another
minute. So while we're waiting, I wanted to give everybody a quick
little update about sort of what's going on in the whole Aetherium
ecosystem. So if you have not checked Twitter, there was an
incredibly exciting announcement that was pushed out just a few
moments ago. They just announced the official date or post date for
the merge on a theorem, which is incredibly exciting. So it's
planning to be happening either on September 15, or September 16.
Which is awesome. Really, really excited to see that finally moving
forward. I know everyone's been waiting for that to happen for quite
some time. So, looks like we have one of the one of the different
team members just hopping into the speaking slot. Hello, hello. How's
it going? How you doing today?</font></p>

Awesome. So thank you, everybody for joining. This is a another L two
on air. Today we have a team called to Vera, who is joining us. They
are building out a a gamified project on top of z k sync. I won't
talk a little bit. I won't talk too much about them and what they're
doing, I will let them speak for themselves. If you aren't familiar
with Noumea, we are a noncustodial mobile wallet on Aetherium. And on
z k sync and allowing for people to buy sell trade and invest into
crypto. But today we are focusing primarily on to Vera and what they
are building. So thank you all for joining and why don't you give a
quick introduction about yourself, Robin and then if you can give us
a little bit of background about what to Vera is and how you guys got
the project to start. We'd love to learn more.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
sure. I'm Robin, I'm the CEO and co founder activator. My background
is in product and engineering. In the last 17 plus years I have built
and sold various software products and solution that simplifies user
experience and focuses on providing a rich customer experience in the
products that we built. So for me to veer I started with a vision of
creating a gamified and decentralised Metaverse, while simplifying
the complexities of onboarding the web to users to web three, and
elevating the experience for our current web three use users right
and increasing that adoption across the board. The question that
you're asked is what is to bear out so Teva in Hebrew word is, stands
for nature and the era represent a neat new web three world of
gamification. So together you have come up with arise to the era. We
are building a gamified makeover Metaverse aka we lovingly call it
Tebow wars that is a immersive and engaging Metaverse where you can
play have fun with adventure games with our guardian characters and
new friends. You can socialise with your with the repertory community
in a naturalistic setting. While participating in the digital well
being to escape some of the digital noise and while building are the
building blocks up to there. So Kibera wants exclusively right now on
a fully decentralised and trustless network is ek Singh, enabling a
player owned economy, digital asset ownership dynamic on chain
reputation and simplifying the web three gaming experience.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome,
thank you for that. Thanks for that introduction. And I know you guys
are are working on a few things, I guess within the I'll call it the
Tavera ecosystem right now or the Teva verse. I don't know what you
guys call it. But I would love to learn more about I guess your first
game that you all have launched in get, I guess some feedback, what
were some of the like the learning experiences that you had? And I
guess some of your thought processes behind launching on z k sync Are
you What were some of the other solutions that you were looking to
deploy onto. So as a little bit of background, there is a product
that Tavera has already launched, which is called Tebbutt. Quest. So
we'd love to learn more like essentially what it is what your thought
process was behind launching on z k sync, were there any other l tos?
And what were some of the challenges that you guys faced in terms of
that? That deployment process? Good</font></p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">question,
I think, you know, it's it's been an interesting journey to get
started here. So our first product we launched was a MVP slash
community engagement game, it's called Teva quest. So Teva is the
nature and quest, right? And we wanted our citizens who, you know,
get to meet their free citizen ID on Zika thing to experience the
game. And this particular game was focused on building our community
and our testing our go to market strategies in terms of free to play
games, with Karma point incentives. And we can talk about that more
in a little bit. And then introducing some real fun games to the web
three users and wanted to see what their response would be to play a
game that was fun and challenging. And quest based westerns, you
know, a lot of the blockchain games we see is task based, right? Like
we wanted to bring some of the fun aspect of it, I wanted to see how
the reptile community would respond to that. And we also wanted to
test how does all of those pieces tie in with Blockchain
capabilities. So we are, we are pleased to say that we had a really
good adoption and feedback from the web three community, we had folks
joining from over 100 countries, we had a pretty good run again, in
terms of you know, registrations and over 30,000 registrations over
20,000, citizen IDs minted and but the real number that we kind of
focus on as people are actually playing the game, we have over 5500,
gamers playing various levels of the game. And what we noticed is,
you know, the initial levels, a lot of it, you know, folks completed
and some some of the more complex or challenging levels, right, you
know, fewer and fewer folks, you know, is finishing those. So it's
fascinating to see how those numbers can align up. And these are
learnings that we are taking into account as we are building our
second game, because we want this to be a experience where you can
escape some of the digital noise and have fun in the in the in the in
the metaphors, right and in, in our games and all the different games
that we introduce. And the second question, I think that you asked
was, how did we end up choosing VK? Singh? Yeah, and that was also
joining as well, we looked at many different options, side chains, we
looked at, you know, other chains, side chains like Aetherium. And
then we looked at other chains as well, you know, where you had, you
know, low cost and faster transaction speed. And, ultimately, we've
selected the good thing for, I would say, you know, four or five
reasons. The first one is the shared values and ethos serpentarium.
We value decentralisation, trustless security, that's the good thing
provides, then we wanted to build a sovereign application for the web
three, community. Number two, you know, there's a pretty good debate
about, you know, who is the first KVM, but we believe Zika sync is
the first EVM compatible v k base roll up that is, you know, is ready
for primetime. Right. And that's making the developers that we have,
you know, that is on solidity to build smart contracts and such on
Zika think, much more easier to access and deploy, there's definitely
again, learning in terms of an evolution of how the kissing has
started to support more native, smart contract features. So that's
definitely something you know, we've been sharing with this ticketing
team as well. The third is the features that we get out of the
tickets in case the smart session wallets through account abstraction
and VK Porter, which is, you know, we would call it a in the layer
three for in game microtransactions and the speed and</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">the
lowest transaction cost associated with those gaming's right gaming
transactions. We wanted to achieve that and that aligns with our
roadmap and our strategy, which, you know, is it getting provides
and, you know, the last couple of years you know, we admire and
respect the model FCM and buildings ICA saying and their unmatched
commitment to scale a Tyrian without any compromises when it comes to
decentralisation and security, and then we strongly believe, you
know, based on all our research at z k base roll up is the future for
scaling Aetherium and onboarding the next billion users to the web
three world. So, in short, you know, we are focused on accelerating
the onboarding process up to Vieira plus, because think of think is
going to be a really good option for for our community here. Does
that answer your question? Mark? Awesome.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark
Anstead  15:36</b>  </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
no, that definitely answered your question. And what one thing I'm
I'm definitely, I guess, curious about so with you all being and I
would say like a gamified project. Obviously, one of the things that
you did mention that you have introduced, are these things called
Citizen ID IDs, the citizen IDs when when someone goes to meet them?
Is it essentially an NF T that's minted on z k sync? Or is that
something that's done more? So is like something that you do within I
guess, your own servers or or how does that how does that work? Yeah,</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Tevaera
 16:13</b>  </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">good
question. So, you know, first that is, you know, citizen ID is
essentially a gate for our pro access to our products and acts as a
as a layer to accessing to better products right, and it is a it is a
ERC 721 standard based NFT right now, it is available and in
production, on Zika think 1.0 through a Zika thing, SDK integration.
So the you know, the NF T's that are being minted is on the kissing
blockchain, he can verify that on both IPFS as well as on the Zika
scan to with the with the actual 721 tokens, it is unique to you as
an individual, it is not meant to be transferable and such and as
the, as we shipped to the Zika thing 2.0, we can talk more about that
it is going to be a native smart contract within sequencing. And it
will also become evolutionary as a dynamic NFT as well. And
currently, it is available in like I said in production, and later
this month, we are also looking to get that available in test net. So
we can you know, start having our test Net community start
experiencing the gameplay as well as new products that you're
launching. And the citizen ID will act as a gateway to that.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Job
Awesome. Thank you for that. And I guess when someone goes to I
guess, like, they go to your website, and they go to I guess create a
citizen ID and then they look to go and essentially play the game or
games that you guys are building. There's this thing called karma.
When you go to like log in and you create an account or become a
member you're able to earn this stuff called karma. Is that
essentially like your version of I guess in game XP or experience
points? And are they able to be redeemable for anything? And if so,
what are they able to be redeemable for</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Tevaera
 18:21</b>  </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">really
good question. So the short answer is yes, it is similar to
experience point but one of the library a little bit more than that.
So Karma is a Sanskrit word which means action war or deed to karma
is definitely an integral part of our vision that we are aware we are
offering an opportunity to the Vetri community to own karma points
through the intent the actions and by participating in our gamified
Metaverse and as far as redemption and you know what the value is
concerned it that's a good question as well you know karma points
will have utility</font></p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Sorry
for kind of disconnected here. No worries. So we're just saying karma
points are redeemable you know, in future it would have value it'll
have utility value, right. So starting with our next arcade game, our
community that has the community the karma point would be able to use
that in the game. And so obviously it is it is in game currency and
in future karma point may be redeemable whatever tokens there will be
details that will still fly Shout, we have not launched our token.
So, you know, that's not available. We are focused on building the
core product first at Avira wanted to build a community and utility
behind it. And then we will focus on, you know, getting the, the
tokens and such, you know, available, right. So that's a that's a
that's a big part of, you know, how we want to get the community
engaged is through karma points and building utility for that within
our products, and then making those transferable and redeemable etc
in future.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome,
very cool. And I guess, as a part of it, you sort of touched a little
bit around like you have things in products that you're focused on.
Like what what else do you have on your roadmap? Because obviously,
right now, you have to have a quest, which is live. What other Do you
have, like other games on your roadmap? I know, we're probably going
to talk a little bit about the metaverse that you guys are working
on, and maybe your marketplace. But do you have like what other? Do
you have other games that you are working on? If so, is there
anything that you can share about them?</font></p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
sure. So in our immediate, you know, hopefully within the week, we
are planning to go live on Zika saying 2.0 either end of this week or
early next week. That includes the smart contract based citizen ID
NFT. We will start supporting minting the citizen ID using the ERC 20
tokens that is supported by Zika saying using you know as a as a
method to pay for the minting fee right now, it's available only
through eat right. So there's a change for that kind of a Quest game
that is our MVP game is also going to be available in in our test
environment, the test net, and allow you know, folks to, you know,
gain additional karma points. And then we are also integration, we
are building integration with Graph Protocol to build our leaderboard
and creating a more improved user experience. And again, much more
detailed roadmap around all the things we will building is available
on TV tv.com. And as far as our second game is concerned, we are
keeping the details under wraps for that right for right now. But we
can tell you that it will be a major game that we will introduce with
some cool characters, and also a clever voice, which is our version
of our Metaverse concept. It will be a multiplayer game that you can
play both with your friends as well as web three gamers, we will do
all the multiplayer networking and matchmaking create rooms and such,
it will be available both on the web and mobile both on iOS and
Android, only q4 and we are trying to sync it with Zika sync 2.0 On
Main net, which we all heard last night in the last few weeks around,
you know, it'll be 100 days to main net. Right. So we are trying to
train to align our roadmap closely to that. So very excited about the
game and the we believe the reptile community is going to absolutely
love it.</font></p>

ecosystem. So ya know, I'm really excited for that as as well. I
guess I have a quick question about timberland. So I was checking out
your website. And this is essentially a Metaverse that you are
looking to build. How and this is, I guess sort of a general question
for a lot of teams that are building meta meta versus as a whole. How
do you essentially different? Like how does one Metaverse
differentiate themselves from another metaverse? And what are some of
the things that you've learned from other teams that are building
meta versus to learn like what they've done right things that they've
done wrong to sort of improve on what your team is looking to do?</font></p>

good question. Again. You know, a lot of the current Metaverse
projects are focused on the futuristic experience. Whereas to Vera,
we want to take you back in time in a story which is mesmerising,
refreshing and lets you have fun in a naturalistic and gamified
metaverse. Our vision is to build the metaverse where you can have
fun playing games going on. adventures with your friends and also
allowing you a space to reset and focus on digital wellbeing. We are
also addressing problems in the current Metaverse of lack of
gameplay, with our arcade games, bringing utility to NF TS with
dynamic NF Ts and focusing on simplifying the user experience every
step of the way. Whether it be through social logins, or in game
wallets or like this, there's a lot we have planned around
simplifying that experience. Because when you think about, you know,
the average user, they don't want to be, you know, go through all the
complexities and the craziness that we have in the user experience
today, right? How do we simplify that? How do we make that easier and
simpler are some of the key problems we're trying to solve? Right?
And let them just have fun right and, and create value for themselves
and, and create a vision for their version of the metaverse, in other
words, is really where we are focusing our time and effort on
starting with, you know, playing fun games and creating that
belongingness and for the community.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome,
that's, that's super cool. I appreciate that. Because that's always
been one thing that I've been trying to sort of figure out myself,
when looking a lot of a lot of meta versus it's, it's very, very
interesting concept with how people are looking to tackle that. And I
guess since you guys are building out your own Metaverse, obviously,
you're going to have your own NF T's that people are, I guess maybe
able to be able to earn, potentially like purchase through like NFT
drops and things like that. Are you all planning to build your own
NFT marketplace? Or are you looking to initially leverage other
marketplaces and then build your own? Or what is your what is your
game plan there?</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
so we'll have a combination of those where we will be leveraging
marketplaces as well as our own to so we'll have NF T's with value
and utility based that allows tenants which would be our citizens of
Kibera to access and experience different products but within within
Tefera. And our citizen IDs, you know, can be mentored right now for
free on Zika cinquain. Net, and in our second game, we will have what
we're calling user generated NF T's that can be minted once the gamer
has unlocked certain levels and achievements in the gameplay. And in
future we will bring NF TS what we call as premium NF T's that will
be part of our timberland Metaverse experience. And you know, in
short, we believe in building value based NF T's more, that is more
than JPEGs. Right. And we are definitely very excited about bringing
one of the first dynamic NF Ts to zycus.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Super
cool. That That definitely makes sense. Obviously, under understand
that, and I guess I'm kind of curious, in terms of, I guess, NF T's?
Are people going to be able to earn NF T's from your games? Or are
you more more so focusing on people essentially building out their, I
guess, to Vera ID? Because I know you've mentioned a few times where
you really want that to be a dynamic NFT where it's able to
essentially grow and evolve as you're playing and interacting with
different types of games. Are people going to be able to earn NF Ts
by playing the game? Or is it you essentially like purchase NF Ts and
then interact with the game? Similar to most I would say like video
games today? Or like freemium games, I would I should say or how are
you how are you planning to have that operate?</font></p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Both
I would say again, we'll have NF T's that they would be able to earn
within the game itself and more importantly they would be able to
create their own custom NF TS within the within the platform as they
are playing the game right. So as a gamer, when you unlock certain
levels, you evolve your character with different cool power ups and
you know, you know, accessories and all those things right? You are
creating some you essentially created your avatar within the type of
words right? And then you can meant that as an NFT. That is unique to
you. And you can then you know have that NFT also made available to
you know, to sell in the marketplace, right and when you sell in the
marketplace, anybody who is buying them at t would be able to Use the
NFT as a starting point to access the game at a higher level within
our games. Does that make sense?</font></p>
