<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">a
book called letting go the pathway of surrender by Professor David
Hawkins.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Rohit

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Well,
nice. How's the book so</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Gurkha
 4:43  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">the
book is actually quite amazing it's like basically how to get
detached consciously from certain emotional states. A person is going
through All right, so, so there's like the good state, which is
obviously like love and joyfulness, and the negative state is for
example. Hate, grief and apathy, for example, like everybody feels
this kind of emotions every now and then. But how to analyse these
emotions from a higher consciousness perspective. So I'm like, really
into, I'm really into like the spiritual stuff.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Very
cool. What's the book called?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Um,
letting go to serve the pathway of surrender,</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Rohit

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">the
pathway of surrender. Very nice. Yeah, I really recommend it to
someone who is going through a tough time or anything like that.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Gurkha
 5:52  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">No,
it's not only for tough time, it's just generally letting go of
ideas, desires, thoughts, experiences, that can be negative or
positive, doesn't it? It's like neutral. Got it. Got it. Because
some, because like, the human, we, as a human retry, we tend to
sometimes get fixated to certain stuff, or our ego is like trying to
fixate to certain stuff. And we tend to build a character around it.
And we like, attached to certain outcomes. As, as mentioned before,
doesn't matter if it's like, it's a negative outcome or a positive
outcome, but we're still attached at the end of day to this outcome
is like how to let go and just be present of time at the moment, to
enjoy it without really thinking too much ahead or in the past,
without adding our ego just being in a sense.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Rohit
| rgoyal.eth  6:52  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Got
it. Very nice. Very cool. Like, yeah, I guess it's sometimes like
books like these. I feel like we can read when we are in good mind,
but there are very few books probably, which a person who is going
through a hard time can read and it can help him or her and like I
was trying to ask from that perspective, because I know a few people
who are basically going through a bad state and when you mentioned
like, it teaches about how to let go on the state of like grief,
apathy, sadness, so I just immediately thought, can I recommend them
this book?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Gurkha
 7:33  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
of course, of course. I mean, like, the concept of detachment is
actually a simple concept, but it's so hard to use it in your daily
life. Because you're, you're always attached to certain kinds of
stuff, but this is this is like all the subconscious stuff which
which is actually essentially happening in your brain. So most of the
stuff we're feeling is all subconsciously trauma, like from past
traumas. Parents, let's say so to speak relationship, I don't know
bad decisions when you were young, you know, stuff like that is like
all traumatic stuff, which is still stored in a subconscious and it
reflects on our actions in the present if you're not like completely
healed with certain kinds of traumatic stuff. So I mean, I would
recommend this book to everybody everybody who's like tense to maybe
he's a stress you know, he might be an overachiever is like stressing
himself too much. Or, you know, some someone who's like, complete his
elite, he's joyful, but still, you know, something, he doesn't
understand why he wants more because the ego is craving for more, you
know, so, I would, I would say it's a book for everybody really? Are
you reading something at the moment?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Rohit
| rgoyal.eth  9:02  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Man,
like, most of my time is just spent into reading blogs telegram and
discord probably like I really hate it. But I'm not able to read
anything at all these days. Like not not a book or anything like
that.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

 9:18  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
yeah, too busy. Yeah, I was like, how, what's your, as a founder, you
know, as a crypto guy, what's your actually your daily routine? How
does it actually look what that tried to try to give me your
perspective to perspective of Rohit when he wakes up, you know, like,
until he goes to, you know, back to bed. Well, how's your, what does
your life look like?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Rohit
| rgoyal.eth  9:42  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
so I think this starts with discord. So like just trying to catch up
what happened till I logged off last night. So that takes sometimes
like half an hour, sometimes one hour, and then in that itself, there
are conversations which needs my attention like ongoing work that is
going on because, like, you know, we are a community to an
organisation. So that's how we communicate with each other on
Discord. So it then continuously require my attention like,
continuously keep checking discord. Then from there, I start going
through telegram. So my telegram is like always a mess, it's always
so many unread messages. So I just try to open that. In that, that
bit. Like even if I open one check, sometimes there are important
information in that there might be a link or two, like, which I might
need to read. Sometimes, like for an example, I were just going
through a check from a friend whom I met in Amsterdam. So this guy's
trying to raise around, and he basically shared his deck. So if I'm
reading his chat, I have to read his deck at the same time, because
if I miss out on that, and my message automatically reads it's as as
read, then I'm not going to open it again. So for me, like, it
becomes super crucial that I read the deck at that point in time only
and then respond to that guy. At that point time only otherwise, like
I'll miss out and then like, obviously, it will create a bad
experience for the other person as well, who was relying on me, and
obviously, for me as well, because then I'm not gonna look at it. So
that, that takes a lot of time to like, even right now, there are 800
Plus messages I need to go through some of that will be in groups.
And this is only on only the groups which are not muted, like which
are important. So I need to go through that. It's, it's like never
ending. Then I try to read what I have left, sometimes like you have
tonnes of tabs open in your browser, which you want to read about.
These are mostly research articles or stuff about crypto, like what's
going on your staff and your bids, spend some time on Twitter as
well, if if I get some time, then like these Twitter's face or an
example like all of these activities also keep going on like I do a
lot of Twitter spaces, and that itself requires a little bit of
preparing time. So that takes a lot of time. Other than that, like
just like talking to people, if I get some time after that.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Oh
that's true. I forgot I forgot about that. Yeah, my routine is a
little bit different. Mostly I wake up in the morning. I tried to do
not like this you know, this YouTube entrepreneur kind of routine are
take a cold shower and do this and that you know, like on the YouTube
and Tiktok and whatever you know this like these videos, my routine
is I wake up mostly drink coffee or tea and meditate a little bit to
get my get a head start. Same for me is as well like taps. I've got
1000s of taps. Tried to think, Okay, what's the next content going to
be about? Try to strategize. Take a look at the charts. Every now and
then. And yeah, go out for a walk and read a lot actually essentially
like books and stuff. So kind of a different lifestyle. I guess.
You're based in Bangalore. Right?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Rohit

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">You
were quite busy. Is with all of the conferences in Bangalore. Tell me
a little bit about that one.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Rohit
| rgoyal.eth  14:01  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah.
Not not lot of conferences in Bangalore as such. Like, one of the
major one that happened was a stock con, which was organised by ZK x.
So I went there. Someone from Gulf from stock there was there and
some people from neither mind were there. There might be a big there
will be a big stock net conference during Athelia. So I'm still like
just talking to multiple people for that. It could be started SEC
India, who knows it could be stock corn, India, whatever basically.
So that is something like I spending some time on, but other than
that, like not, I do not attend a lot of events. Sometimes, like
there are online events, but those are Again, more from the
educational perspective where the audience is like, going through,
let's say, a series of chapters or 10 chapters or 10 sessions,
something like that. It's like a bootcamp programme if you think
about it. So sometimes so I go over there for for like a session
skip, like as a speaker or something like that.</font></p>

India. Last time I was in India, I think was with my dad visiting my
brother. I was about six years old. That was the only time I was in
India. Yeah. Wow, indoor. It was an indoor</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">like
a city of immigrants. So like the problem with Bangalore is Bangalore
infrastructure is like really bad. You can't move around much like it
will take you an hour just to go five kilometre six kilometres. So
it's really bad. Like, I'm not sure if you were checking Twitter last
week, but it was raining heavily in in Bangalore and streets were
flooded like in many parts of the Bangalore and boats were like
literally, like one of my friend actually, his car just got damaged.
He had some expenditure because of that, because his car was flooded
with water. So, Bangalore has does not have capacity from
infrastructure perspective. And I do not think like, there is a huge
push from even the government side on the development of the city.
Indoor on the other side is a very small city, but they have been
like building infrastructure from the ground up like I've been there,
there is decent weather, it's geographically centre of the India so
very well connected. Many people are coming there and many companies
are coming there. I feel like it will go on to become something like
Bangalore next, Bangalore for India.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I
can't remember how endo looks. It's like just a backstory. My, my
brother used to live in India. And he went to school to India with my
sister with my eldest sisters, and I was living in Nepal. So that's
where we were visiting them every now and then. I'm like, funny. The
funny thing about it is, my brother is Austria. He's Austrian is
white. And he was he can speak fluent Hindi. And he's essentially a
Indian. Because he grew up there, and now he's living in a party in
Kathmandu, actually. So that's why we were very often in Indore, two
three times I think, altogether, something like that. Yeah.</font></p>

I love it. I miss it. Actually. It's the it's, I live in. I live I
live in Europe, in Central Europe. I live next to Germany. And I
mean, the life is different completely. And for me, personally, I
like this hectically city life. It's a big city. It's a it should be
a big city, very hectic. A lot of energy a lot of synergies. I love
that kind of vibrations. Because it pushes you pushes me a little bit
but like, for example, the place where I'm living it's sleepy. The
city itself has actually to town it has around 760 1000 people maybe
it's a small town. Very very postcard like and nothing to do here
much actually, to be honest. Not especially crypto. I live I live in
Austria. So Austria is actually quite boring in regards of crypto.
Well, there's bit panda but that's the only bigger company I know.
And I and the 10x guys. They were also Austrian apparently. And Doa
hacker allegedly.</font></p>

itself is very interesting, fascinating culture, different culture.
The people are very admiring, they struggle a lot to basic income the
worker left, so to speak working class to struggle a lot. I mean, I
think it's the same in India as well, middle class is growing slowly.
The infrastructure has changed a lot over the past few years. People
are very lovely. And I went, I went on a hike. And you could see the
rural places how the people are living there, and they live, they
actually live quite peacefully and tranquil. And simple, and but the
simplicity itself is very beautiful, how they, how they live, versus
the big city. People, for example, in Kathmandu, but when I was in
April, I was super scared because I was still trading MFTs and
Bitcoin and stuff like that. And it's actually illegal there and I
didn't know it. So while I was still staying in April and every round
in trading I was always thinking to myself, all them what will happen
if they catch me? Yeah, well, I did use a VPN but the police
themselves they're quite frugal, you know, that. They could go to the
police and be the guys doing something illegal. So you can like trust
everyone. There so I was quite, you know, anxious. Man, besides that,
it was great to get a feeling of my culture again. And that's
actually where we're, I came up with the idea crypto Gurkha. Because,
because my, from my mother's side, all of my family members are gorko
warriors. So I was sitting at home and started writing threads. And I
thought to myself, Hey, why should I just call myself crypto Gurkha
sounds a nice name and I want to represent naipo With
cryptocurrencies. So that's how actually the whole idea started while
I was in April.</font></p>

this, it's like a deal. Which which happened between the Queen and
actually the king at that time of England, England, the Empire?
United United Kingdom? Yeah. The king of United Kingdom back then
still the Empire they were they were looking for warriors to try to
take over an EPA but it couldn't take over an EPA. So instead of
taking over an EPA, he suggested a peace treaty, hey, why don't you
give give us some warriors. And we'll pay them. So that's how it
happened. They were fighting for England since 250 years. And so
basically, they were fighting for they were fighting every literally
every important war where the British were the where the British
Empire was still fighting. So that's how it happened. And it's still
the same today. But the difference is to getting paid and you'll
receive a English password afterwards. So in my case, my father's my
mother's side. My uncle was a warrior soldier and my grandfather was
a Gurkha police officer. So actually, this name crypto Gurkha is just
honouring my family and the country of nipple and crypto because it's
like kind of a warrior like crypto warrior. So that's how I came up

yeah, it was actually I've been in crypto since 2015. Actually even
2014. And one of my first Bitcoin I bought was 2015. And afterwards,
I was trading every now and then I got into trading. I was like, oh
damn, what's this lines and you know, candles and whatever. And I did
my licenced trading licence on the Austrian and German exchange.
Afterwards, I started trading heavily. And 2000 Bull Run 2000 to 2017
Bull Run happened. got wrecked, because I started trading on bit Mex,
that was my first time getting wrecked. And the second time now is
basically I was still trading every now and then and I got a job
offer at the bank as a as a execution trader. So I took the job
because I needed money while I was working, I was also trading. And I
basically grew my portfolio quite well over the last bull market.
Yeah, well, so to speak, I got wrecked because I essentially got
greedy. You know, it's nothing else to say because the amount of
money I was making was too overwhelming for me. And especially for
someone who never really had, you know, got the experience of having
so much money at once. It was kind of overwhelming. And I think I was
also a little bit arrogant. Because I was trading so well even like
shorting peaks. And the first time I got really wrecked was when I
shot shorted Dogecoin that was shortly before the SNL thing I knew
this is the top sign I was building up a small position on FTX. And
afterwards, essentially, I got short squeezed. Because the size the
size was as was so big, I had some liquidity issues and I got
wrecked, even though my leverage wasn't that high. But if if if the
if the chart goes, if the market goes parabolic at once, it will be
difficult to exit especially with sides to liquids out there on the
buy side at least. And yeah. So I got wrecked, and only the good
thing I did. I came like I came into a cycle of getting wrecked.
More. So at one point, I was like, Okay, I have to stop now. took out
all of my last money and travel the world for the last two years. So,
and I was in Mexico, Peru, America and Miami, New York. Columbia now
neighbour and yeah, that was what I was actually doing over the last
two years. And while I was travelling, I was still, you know, doing
NFT stuff and trading a little bit here and there. Mostly reading
education, taking a break of trading so heavily because from 2015 to
2021, I was actually only working my ass off. So I was like, Okay,
enough is enough. I have to take my time off. And you know, re recap
regretted myself and you know, basically start from you. So and this
is where I actually am I'm starting from the scrambles again, so to
speak, because I literally wasted all of my last money just to travel
because I was like I don't</font></p>

the exact number I because I also had like presale bags and NF T's
and you know, all this kind of stuff. So it's like, yeah, you could
and you know, some also locked up it's like difficult to say but my
trading margin was definitely more like on ft ft x at least it was
150. So that was like I was my like my average position size was 1
million.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">No,
I didn't come to zero. I took a really big hit. Because of one
because the Dogecoin trade. And then And then afterwards, everything
like crashed anyways. And I think after the Coinbase to Coinbase when
the Coinbase IPO happened, that was actually a clear top sign for me
personally. And the mistake is was I knew it's a toxin but I didn't
short because I was like I was already enough kind of a fearful state
because of the Dogecoin trade. So I was like shit maybe if I lose if
I short now too heavily I might lose my last money and then And then
my spot bags got wrecked because you know, everything was dropping
anyways. And I was trying to catch I was trying to catch the bottom
like knife catching actually. But that worked out actually quite
well. I timed it quite well, but afterwards because I was already
like, kind of in a fearful state of mind and my focus was not really
there. My edge, I lost every now and then, like, you know, like,
let's say 10 grand, five grand, you know, like once a week maybe. And
I was I noticed my performance is not really bad. Well, rather cash
it out and just enjoy life. That was my, my, my thought process
because like, you can trade anyways, whenever you want. And yeah,
that's what actually happened. So I was like, fuck it, I'm gonna cash
it out. We're just gonna enjoy life for now. With I was like working
anyways too much.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
I will feel like I felt down? Only once. Sorry, not not, I will not
say only once. But the last I really fell down was 2010. And 2010, or
2011? Actually. So this was when I had to shut down my first company.
I was still in college, I was still a kid. Like, what? Maybe 20 year
old 21 year old something like that? 21 I think yeah. So I literally
cried like, Okay, I have to shut down this company, it's like, you do
not have something to look forward to after that you do not know,
what will you do after this. So that that was a downtime. But post
that I never really felt down as such, that does not mean that I felt
success, like I've never been successful, not even till today. And I
had been broke almost forever since college. So I only started like
making some salary since 2020. But till then, like I was literally
borrowing money from my friends to pay my rent and all of that.
Luckily, in India, like that's not a lot like you can survive because
you know, you can, you can get get a job at any day you want. So,
like whatever you are borrowing you will be able to pay back like in
a year or two, whatever. It's not going to be much basically. But at
the same time like It's like this continuous trying things out. So I
failed multiple times. Before this. I started a gaming company. After
my first company in the first company, I was selling fruits and
vegetables online for the first time in India. So I think it was
tough from multiple perspectives when I was this was my first company
and it was like really a hard problem statement. Because India is
really complex from operations perspective. So as a second company, I
started into tech, that's how I got into tech, like I started
designing the website for the first company. So from there, I
realised I really love programming. I love tech in general. And since
this is this was a consumer facing business, like, I felt that like I
really understand, or I enjoy the consumer part. But I don't enjoy
the operations part. So then I started again, trying out different
stuff. Then I started building a game with someone in college again,
before graduating, this was going somewhere, but then the guy I was
building it with, he moved to us. So again, kind of felt like alone,
like, Okay, what's next. But luckily found some people on the
journey. So like the gaming team, giving things kept continuing on.
So I spent like, four or five years building mobile games after that.
In games, there were times like where I launched, my first game was a
complete failure, it had probably less than $100 in revenue in
throughout its life. So and I spent like one and a half year building
that so and during that time, I actually again needed a place to stay
so what I did was I stayed with one of my friend who was still in
college so I again stayed back in my college and hostel room by doing
some hackers shell is basically not legally you can say, but like the
college was pretty nice like not not every nobody asked questions
like guards and or ask questions, but you can always when you are
entering the university, you can say student and they will let you go
or you can just write down random roll number like they don't check
thoroughly. So, I like I was again lucky like this friend let me stay
with him in his hotel room. And this was like nothing fancy like I
was in IIT Bombay and the hostile conditions were really bad from the
infrastructure perspective, but you do not feel that because the
energy is really great there, you you feel that energy. So, after
that, then I launch a new game, which came from a friend of mine with
whom I was meeting consistently a he I met him like during college
years. So, this game kind of tipped it off and I started making some
money to pay my rent.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So,
it was like a spike I made some money, but all of that I made in like
three to six months only and then like again it stopped making any
money. So, during that three to six month time, like when it is
making decent amount of money, you feel like okay, like you made it
you basically survived that period of struggling, but then once you
get to that point and you come back again like it again brings you a
new perspective to you right because it is not long term, you have to
think even longer term from now on, like nothing is certain. So then
I kept trying different things got smaller, smaller successes, I was
able to like just survive somehow like not making any money but also
not building up any any kind of debt on me. And he's like substantial
debt very small debt, which is which which was fine, which never
brought financial pressure. So like big financial pressure to me.
Then around like, end of 2016 I kind of got introduced to crypto
through some friends started reading about it. And that that's when
like, once I read the Bitcoin white paper, like just got super deep
into it very naturally, you can say like, it just made me curious. It
just made me want to learn more about crypto, or what could be
possible. So that that's what what I started doing. And by the end of
2017, then I started this company Moto X, which basically came from
the idea that okay, like many people are trading crypto, and they are
doing manual trading of crypto, we might make their life easier if we
can provide them tools to automate their crypto trading. So that is
something like we started building end of 2017 It didn't go anywhere.
So we got into yc. So again, like that short spike of like, you can
say achievement, because like, I guess Wi Fi is something a big deal
in every entrepreneurs mind who have not made it yet or who have not
touched success in any way. So it gave that again, you can say short
term spike. But then, like I think we hit the bear market in 2018. So
Have we again, like, kept the building for next two years. And I was
trying to raise funds then and probably in that time, I talked to
more than 100 Plus investors in those two years. And I listened to
No, from every single of them, maybe almost like 95% of them. Some
people give me money because of this, like, the company survived. But
luckily, like, we were able to raise some round after, like, when the
markets changed. Post COVID. Today, we are in a healthy condition
like today that that company is now 100 people. And then like, again,
I started thinking, okay, like, whatever I'm doing, I'm still doing
the same that to thing like, it's a crypto company. But it's a web to
crypto company. So, so then I started like, thinking, okay, like,
what do I really want to do? And that's when I started thinking,
Okay, I want to just spend my time in web three, because my learning
kind of stopped when I was the CEO of that company, when I was like
dealing with investors, or like building that company. So I decided,
okay, like, you will keep learning about web three, only by building
web three. So that's when like, I decided to build mesh finance,
which, which you already know, a lot. But yeah, that that was kind of
the journey and even today, like it's nothing like it's a big success
or anything like that. The only only part is like Okay, today, I do
not have any bet Much, much of a date. Like I can pay my bills, and
like I'm enjoying building what I've always enjoyed, basically,</font></p>

love to trade three, I loved it. But now what what I'm currently
doing with all this reading and learning, meeting people, that's what
actually fulfils me a little bit more than just trading. I mean, I
could trade every now and then of course, but like talking to people
meeting people learning this, you know, learning stuff about them,
learning new stuff about starkness Oh, you know, every time every
time I'm preparing for an interview, I'm learning so I never had that
experience. I mean yeah, unless you read for something where you have
to learn but not like out of pure joy and I think I personally think
you can you keep it for yourself way longer because you're like
really actively learning for something which gives you joy and I love
that</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay.
I wouldn't mind. Yeah, I still have to think strategize how to do it,
as well. Because if I, if I'm, if I'm coming to India, I need
somebody who will help me to record so as you know, I have to like,
pay for the flight as well. It's not like that. You have to think
everything through. I mean, my, my tick tock hustle is quite working
quite well, at the moment. On average, I get like 200 views. Okay. So
I'm Alpha, even though there's nobody here to listen. I'm extra Fugo.
Of course, I'm starting like something new on YouTube. Some shorts.
So I'm still like thinking of a nice concept that I'll release it I
think in one two weeks. So like, focused or video No, no, no text
focus video focused. Okay. So I've got started zone. That's text
focus. I did a little research about Tinder and reels and stuff like
how to get viral with the keywords and how you can analyse the
keywords. I did that a little bit. So I'm, like, experimenting with
real. So that's darknet zone. That's primarily only educational
information stuff about our ecosystem. And the crypto worker thing.
What I'm doing is still the same, like threads and YouTube. So
regarding YouTube, I might do something else. So now with your chat
stories, of course. So it's like I'm also kind of building you could
say, you got it. Yeah. I think</font></p>

Nice to have you here. I mean, this is like, just just a short recap
for you. Robert and I, we came up with this idea when we're in Paris,
hey, why don't we just start a Twitter space or a podcast where we
interview people from the community and talk about the life
everything besides crypto and starkman? You know, I mean, of course,
a little bit crypto, but more about life experiences, stories. And
that's why we came up with the idea chat stories, because we believe
everybody has is a chat. Oh, yeah. And as a story has a story to
tell. So yeah, welcome to our first episode. Thank</font></p>

University. I started developing first smart contract in 2018. I was
like 17 years old, I think, because I was in the startups in our
internship. So I was at school and at the company at the same time,
and the company pays the school because school is quite expensive.
And in the company, it was startups and the they wanted to come in
blockchain and Ethereum. So I was like, in the research department
was like five people. That's, that's nonsense, but, and I was
developing in solidity. And just too few use cases, you know, like,
trust abilities, for rent, etc, but not in defy your energy or big
things we have now. Just a small use case. And it was quite fun,
Arthur, that I continue in the startups and doing like mobile, mobile
development in the US and Android. About flutter. I had no issue. You
heard the technology. The technology flutter out, made by Google, I
think, yeah. Yeah. And I think you got Bing is working, actually in
with Dart, and K rising or stagnate. Dart or don't remember the
project, but and yeah, next year, last year, I think, or the in
December or January, I discovered dotnet. I was I continued in
solidity. And I don't know where or who told me about dark net? I
don't remember that. Maybe it was a torque. Yeah, maybe the torque

the crypto ecosystem, I think, because it's like the future, if you
continue to build on solidity is like it's always here. It's like the
basics of foundation. And if you want to grow, maybe you need to, to
see the new solution. For for example, layer two, or dt, dt key.
There is so much possibility and Yeah, dark net was layer two zip
key. So it was like, was amazing technology and let's go build some
some cool stuff and discover the ecosystem. And it was like quite
fun, and very cool. And now I'm here with you How old are you? 21</font></p>

and I was okay. It was like this. Actually. I was I was still working
as a waiter, I guess. Yeah, I was like, Wait, yeah. But I was like, I
was always very common. Like, you're working with the waiter. Yeah.
But like always, like over accomplishing because I was I was a
retired in school. I was one of the smartest in class, you could say,
but I was a retired because I was bad. You know, misbehaving bad,
sir. Because I was like this typical. Idiot. 70 year old, no, sorry,
1415 and 16, your teenager. And I was like, Okay. Other schools
didn't want me because of I had bad grades. And they were in school
and stuff like that. So I thought, Okay, should I have to look for a
job. And then, and then it was like, I was looking for multiple jobs.
And I applied for the best hotel in Austria, back then. And I never
thought they would take me but they took me and thanks to them, I
could. That's what that was, like my first fundamental life, how to
conversate with people how to, you know, think, for yourself in
service quality and stuff like that, because I was working every
department in the hotel. So let's say if you would put me in a hotel
today, in the hospitality business in a hotel, I could I could
already be a manager and stuff like that. So because I learned
everything on hand. That was what I was doing when I was 70 and
partying and getting blasted chasing girls and doing stupid stuff.

I how I think I was 21 when I found out about crypto I should have I
think if I will change I'm not I don't regret anything I think I
believe nobody should regret the decisions and stuff he did in his in
his life because it's a part of you in the present. So though, what I
could say maybe what I regret is that I didn't focus on develop
developing because when I was 2021 I mean, I think I could I could
have learned it i But I focused on trading and investment and trade
trade fi so that was like my focus when I was 21. So that's when I
got that's when I got the banking job when I was 24. Yeah. Okay,
nice. So I like a different pathway, or route you could say yep.
Google, do you have any any challenges now? So when you like when you
develop stuff, or I don't know what like on your daily routine, do
you have do you have like some kind of challenges you're tackling</font></p>

odd. And it was only during one month or two months. Because after I
was like, knocked down you know, it was like dying. I just need to
sleep. The is not a good. Good good life. You know, a good I don't
know the word but a thriller. Yeah, yeah. exhausted his life. Yeah,

sometimes. It's important. But not not too many. Because I was on
only days, like, during 10 days in August. And when I remember, when
I came back, I was like, What the hell there is so many things. Like
build for example, on Stargate, etc. There is so many things. Project
or I don't know project continue to build being excetera I need to,
