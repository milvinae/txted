TXTED is basic archive of crypto twitter spaces in text format.

A few notes...

- The website is basic. Very basic. There are also not a lot of entries yet.

- I can take down any chats if requested. I also haven't added the audio files.

- The transcriptions have had no spelling/grammar corrections

- Tagged names might be wrong

- It would be nice to do this on something like Lens but I don't want to post on-chain if it is going to upset anyone (deletions) so we can work that out if it goes that far

- Finally I'm not even sure if this is allowed or has been done already?
