of people in here. So thank you, everybody for joining. It is
recording so we'll make sure to get this space, you know, posted up
in our Discord and YouTube and wherever on the interwebs after, but
again, just to kind of kickstart us. I'm Weston Nelson. From, from
layer two doubt. That's the icon you see here speaking. And today,
I'm here with Hannah from Guild XYZ, and we're hosting a mini series
on community and community building in web three. And so today we
just wanted to kick it off with like, like we were just joking about,
you know, 15 minutes tops so 1220 cut us off. Yeah, but an intro to
just kind of you know, background on on ourselves, the communities
we're currently building. And then the topics that we're going to be
covering over the next for the mini series, the next three, which
will be more fleshed out, you know, kind of in depth conversations.
So, anything you'd want to add to that kind of took it</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
that was, I was gonna say, um, so I was thinking maybe, if it just
start, could we just introduce ourselves, like, individuals real
quick? And then the communities?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yes,
yes. Yes. So we can start with like a quick, like contributor
background introduction, like how we got into the space, actually.
Or? Yeah, well, actually, like, if I'm talking about myself, it's a
really tricky question. Because to describe my journey to web three,
I would say like, I've gone straight into the deep like, in the
middle of community manager live. Because in terms of like,
experiences, I come from a like kind of similar, but still different
background coming from human resources. And my experience is I work
in community management, in like a co working space. So I have like
experience in like ERL, community management, but never in like
online community management. So I did this during my undergrad
studies. So when I finished with all my studies, I went straight into
deep and I just, I just applied for a community manager position.
And, um, and I got it. And here I am. Oh, wow. I cannot really talk
about like contributions. Because, yeah, I just came from like, being
an undergrad into being like about three community manager. And I
just learned all like along the way, like I got here. So it was kind
of like, a really, like, a pretty new, but still an exciting journey
with the guild team. What about you?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">So
mine's not as cool. My mom's pretty straightforward and boring. I
started in traditional finance. You know, spent several years
different firms was financial advisor, and then got into data
analytics, and then found crypto few years ago, and then started
getting involved in Dows. And like, learning to write code, smart
contracts, maybe like a year ago, please. That's yeah, I know. I just
love it so much. And I've just been continually seeing the power of
community. The impact of community on a protocols success being such
an integral part that is overlooked, that I see the importance, I
just, I see how important it is. And that's why I've taken such a big
focus on I think, personally. So yeah, that's, that's, I mean, that's
pretty much it for me. Nothing.</font></p>

Currently, I'm focusing on the on the guild XYZ, and learning along
with the different committees who are joining us, like who started
using our product, and, you know, like getting in touch with them and
like, getting to know their kind of projects and their communities
like what they're doing so I'm just looking around and seeing what
the others are doing but like currently In this moment we are
talking. It's Yes. All it is</font></p>

So like you, you, If I could sum that up you can I engage in other
communities to get feedback, learn from them. And then you also are
sharing, you know, your own best practices and guild. So,</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

exactly. I'm like reaching out, like, not only about like, feedbacks
or like products or anything, but also like just getting the vibe,
getting in touch just how we did it. Because the way we got in touch,
it wasn't about exactly the product, we started talking about
committee started talking about, like engagement and layering. And
it's a really fun way to you know, like, get some friends on the net.</font></p>

yeah. I don't even remember how, honestly researching something like
that. Yeah. But no, I know exactly what you mean. So okay, so you're
just killed. And then I just a little background for me, I am on the
team there to Dow, which is a it's a it's an investment, Dow focused
on high impact Ethereum L to place. So basically, you could say,
like, you know, to really keep it simple. We're looking for protocols
and projects that are advanced, advancing the LTE ecosystem, and
making user adoption for web three, you know, globally, much more
accessible. And, yeah, I'll just leave it at that as I can, because I
could go on for that for hours on that too. And then I'm also
involved with settle finance, I'm on the multisig at saddle, which is
a stable swap. Very, very awesome protocol. And then fails protocol.
I'm an Oracle counsel there, which is a very interesting and unique
primitive from in terms of a defy application. So they're actually
going to be in L to dow for a feature a demo of all their tools in
about a week. So that's kind of my main focuses. Right now, and oh,

yeah. Yeah. No, thanks for bringing that up. So for yeah, that's,
it's like, kind of, it's, how do you say, we, so we launched our, so
we have our token now to Dow, right. And we're going to have a new
single sided staking token to pay soon. Soon TM. It's, you know, but
but we launched an NFT called the L two state of mind, which is, you
know, kind of a cool, name it it got trending on Twitter and
everything, which was awesome. But it, it's about more than that. And
it's about really having, having that like next level mindset to take
us where we are from where we are to where we want to get to through
web three, and technology and community. And that's kind of like the
vision behind the whole project. And so that's what's really cool
about it to me. And then once people realise the benefits that are
involved with it, I think it'll, I think it'll create some magic. So
I'm excited for it. Thanks for bringing it up.</font></p>

So okay, the purpose of the mini series, a, you know, in general, I
think we hopefully have kind of hinted this, but basically,
communities web three communities, engagement, good ways, bad ways.
It's become a big, big topic in the digital world and web three. And,
you know, we figured, hey, we have a lot of experience here. Why
don't we you know, put something other insurance? And so we came up
with a topic, do you? Do you want to share the topics? And I do want
me to? Or? Well, I mean, we wrote them in the tweet, but we can we
can go over them briefly, I suppose.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif"><b>ikbenhan.eth
 15:15</b></font><font face="Arial, serif">  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
let me just tell them and then you can like, tell, like in like, like
the extra points that you have for them. So basically, as you said,
like, we just partnered up to host these amas. Because we want to,
you know, like, spread the word and share all our like, experiences
what we have and be really transparent, or like what we were
experiencing, because we have like different kinds of communities
like, there are different kinds of like experiences and things and,
and we decided to have like specific episodes in this amas section
like ama series. And so the topics that we'll cover in the next three
episodes, our first next week will be about the future of
communities, like the importance of communities, like jamming around,
like the types of web three communities like all these collective
values and purposes, like how it's working with decentralisation and
more. The next one will be about contribution. And it's a tricky one,
because like, there's no blueprint for that, like, the more
communities we like, faced with and rejoin there are the more and
more like contribution types, we're just faced with also. So we want
to cover this topic from both the point of the contributors, they
want to be contributors who are interested in like, how they can
start, and both the community builders, like how how it's like,
should be part of the whole community strategy to work on the
contribution lifecycle, if it makes sense.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif"><b>L2DAO
 17:07</b></font><font face="Arial, serif">  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
exactly. But both from both sides as and this is something that I
know at least NLT Tao, our, our contributors were really excited
about because it's like, okay, yeah, how can contribute people who
are interested in contributing? How can they get involved? How can
they find, you know, their right niche that they're, you know, you
know, skilled and capable and interested in being in? And then how
can the Tao build the right culture, and everything to attract the
right people? So it's, it's a really tough problem, but I think, I
think we kind of have some unique ideas on it. So yeah. Exactly.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">And
the the next one, after the contribution, we're gonna talk about the
practicalities, which is like, I'm the most excited about this one.
It's like, what we tried previously, like, what our favourite tools
favourite sides? What we, you know, like, say that, like, those are
the best ones. And I think it's really important to be like, fully
transparent and talk about the other ones that we couldn't success
with.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif"><b>L2DAO

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
we did. What works, what doesn't work? Exactly. You know, here's why.
And here's some ideas for, like, improving, here's what we're doing.
But practical, concrete steps for building an engaged community. You
know, like, like, like, for instance, like, how did how did l two Dow
get to 1000 verified members in such a short time while we did very
specific things. And so we can share? Stuff like that. Yeah, exactly.
So I'm comfortable. All three of them to be honest. But, yeah,
especially so. Okay, so we're at time, so to just try to be ready.
Yeah, sum it up. This is kind of just to kick off of our mini series
on web three community building. Again, I'm Weston's Hannah from
Guild. I'm from L to Tao. We're, I think both very excited about this
the next three sessions. If you have any questions, please start
throwing them out in either of our Discord communities, and we've
already actually gathered like 20 and in hours, so you know, keep
keep keep those coming. Because you know, the next ones will be will
be more like thorough. And then please do share this too far and wide
so we can get the awareness as much as possible. And I think that
that's a good place to wrap it up on this anything else? Or actually,
I do have one quick question for you to wrap it up. But anything else
you'd add?</font></p>

like you said, everything, I would just emphasise that, like, we do
want to know like what you guys are interested about? So like, we
just wrapped up like, what are the episodes are about what we'll be
about? But like, if you have any specific question, or you have an
idea, like to just change the other one and like, talk about this
one, instead of something, just feel free to reach out to us. We are
super open to every suggestion.</font></p>

Perfect. Okay. And so final note then. Curious about yourself, what
to put out to put you on the spot? Sorry. What is it that you find so
exciting about doing what you're doing right now? Because like, in
terms of building communities, and growing them, because I see you
everywhere, helping, like, so many people all over the place? And I'm
just curious, like, what is the spark? Or like, what is the? What is
the thing that like, gets you fired up about it? Oh,</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">well,
I love this question. If I could like wrap it up in like one
sentence, like, what is the thing that is always on my mind when I'm
doing what I'm doing? And while I'm so excited about when we get
tickets? And do you support it, like, it's one thing that you are
building a community, but why you're doing it, the community is
building you also. And this is what's always in my mind, like
everything that you put out for the community is have a reflection on
you. And it's so amazing, like how you are involved evolving as a
person, like how you are involving like, not only with your work and
how you work, it's like your whole personal personality is evolving
with it. And I find it amazing, like I do realise, like what's
happening inside me when I'm building the currency.</font></p>

way. It's great. Thank you for your question. Yes. No, that was that
was like, I'm like, fired up. Now. That was cool. So, so Okay, yeah,
we'll wrap it here. We're sorry. We went four minutes over. But yeah,
thank you, everybody for joining Sirsi we appreciate it so much. And
