working in the building in the staffing ecosystem. And today we have

you for joining. Right. So I guess, let's get started. And perhaps
you can give us a little rundown of your background and what Yogi

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Sure,
absolutely. I'm interested background. I started off as an engineer,
worked at a couple of startups in Silicon Valley, then had a brief
stint in management consulting,</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">working
just as a general consultant making PowerPoint slides and excellent
models.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">then
transition into product management</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">worked
on you know, building some products in the machine learning space in
predictive maintenance. And, and then my final product was an open
source machine learning framework,</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">which
called Kudrow, which is a way to basically build machine learning
pipelines. And that kind of opened up my eyes to the power of open
source and just kind of realise, remember how much I enjoyed working
in developer tools. So crypto seemed to be the perfect place to go
and build open source and go and work on developer tools in 2018. And
so I did that and started working, you know, doing things around the
EVM. So building infrastructure for for other teams, building smart
contracts, focused on security, so worked in you know, formal
verification tools, faster, EVM clients, really kind of low level,
things like that. And then over time, kind of as the market matures,
started doing more smart contract development, and then late last
year, got really interested in darknet and started working on Yagi,
which is a yield I could get on Stark net, we also expose some of the
underlying tools we have, you know, in particular the wall template
ERC 466 wall template as well as the keeper network.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Nice,
nice. So you're you're a builder by by love and passion, by the
sounds of it. Yeah, absolutely. And so what what made you turn your
hand to Yagi? What was the problem you saw? Or what what sort of
growth? Why did you gravitate towards yaki?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">p–e
 7:41  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
I think, I think a couple of things. I mean, one, I think these are
mainly the, I think there's an opportunity to build a yield
aggregator that is really trustless. And so if we look at the yield
aggregation space, right now, a lot of it boils down to kind of a
multisig of strategists that that make decisions off chain, you know,
some of it boils down to kind of machine learning models that are
also sitting off chain, and not necessarily available to, for people
to inspect. And my interest was, hey, can we can we build systems
that are trustless, in the same way that, you know, certain automated
market makers are trustless, or, you know, certain lending protocols
are trustless it's definitely much harder to deal with a yield
aggregator just because it sits, you know, higher up in the stack.
And the higher up, you go in the stack, there's definitely challenges
and making things trustless. And really fully trying to automate
things and making them transparent, but I think it's really rewarding
to figure out this design pattern. So that was the main motivation.
And also I think, you know, really, starting it is going to be this
sort of unique and exciting ecosystem with a lot of exciting
projects, and really allowing those projects to, you know, get
liquidity get exposure, and figuring out kind of what unique
strategies can be built on top is also really exciting, you know,
because it is a platform that allows us, you know, gives us a couple
of new tools, right, in terms of just what we can do. You know, it
makes things cheaper, it makes things more performant. And I think,
for vault developers, that is really exciting. I think that is going
to allow us, you know, to not only do things like compute, you know,
Black Scholes on chain to do options vaults, but also the more
interesting things we probably just haven't haven't thought of yet,
such as, you know, using convex optimization to maybe, you know,
invest in and figure out how we allocate across multiple vaults,
right, things like that, that have traditionally been off chain. So I
think it kind of the two goes go hand in hand. I think, you know, I'm
super excited about the trustless Ness, but I think it's uniquely
enabled by stark</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Nostra
 9:36  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
no, absolutely. And that's one of the key reasons why we built in
nostra is you know, increase the adoption of defy and, you know, we
think that stop now is the right key features and key improvements
that that we need for step change in user adoption. In regards to
transaction costs, and scalability, and speed. Does the question. So
you only finance? What's the what would you say is the main objective
of a user of Yagi? Like you know, what? A very basic level. You say?
Aggregation. What does it trying to do? At a basic high level?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">p–e
 10:20  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
I think I think the main objective is, you know, user would come to
Yagi, if they want to generate yield. But but not only, not only
wanting to generate yield, but also just wanting to discover what the
best yield opportunities are, right. And that's where it kind of word
aggregator comes in, the goal is, you know, not only to kind of
figure out which protocols we should integrate with, and make sure
that we provide exposure to, you know, whatever interesting yield
opportunities, they're on target, but also start to aggregate them
and start to, you know, create vaults that are operating at a higher
level. And that more automatically allowed people to allocate their
funds, right. So definitely at a stage where we feel we have, for
example, you know, three to five, exciting vaults that, you know,
invest in ether, we're gonna we have some designs in mind, to build
vaults that allow, you know, more automatic reallocation of those
funds, right, so that users, not only today, are they able to
discover what exciting yield opportunities they're on starting to,
but they're able to also invest in them fairly frictionlessly. And
they don't have to, you know, check back in every day to update their
positions, they can sort of set and forget if they want, of course,
while also giving some flexibility users that desire it, but really
having that ability to set and forget, I think is a key for
aggregation.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Nostra
 11:36  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
I mean, I do, sort of when I think about yield aggregator and its
role, I can imagine, you know, the high street and you have a row of
banks. And each of these banks have different rates, they'll, you
know, saving rates. And, you know, you'd rather than walking up and
down the high street, trying to check the rates in each bank, you
just have this sort of one stop shop that can do all of that for you.
So you, you leave your your funds, your assets with this, this
contract, or this, this entity, and this entity can then sweep the
floor and have a look to see where the best allocation of, of the
asset is. So yeah, it removes the friction, as you say, and, and is a
layer built upon things like nostre as a money market.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">p–e
 12:25  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Absolutely.
And I'm super excited about that. Because, you know, there's, there's
so many reasons why, you know, we could end up allocating more into
one or the other protocol, right? As you mentioned, you know, if the
interest rates on nostre are higher, that's where the algorithm
should be reallocating more into it, right? But also, if the
insolvency risk in Austria is lower, that also should make it more
attractive, right? So there's actually a lot of different aspects, or
if the smart contract risk is lower, because you know, the contracts
are high quality, and if they're heavily audited, you know, all those
things, ultimately will feature into decisions. So I think it's
absolutely it's definitely a case of trying to build something that
takes advantage of all these factors, and then make the best decision
possible on behalf of users.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Nostra
 13:09  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
that's definitely an interesting one. rating the smart contract risk,
because I don't think that's necessarily been done or incorporated in
your aggregators today. Only, you know, private, perhaps arbitrarily,
you know, the committee or what have you or decide whether to
integrate or not, but not on a smart contract level. So that's,
that's interesting. Could you just like, you know, Yagi, of course,
you think you mentioned that you kind of started building this last
last year? I mean, could you just maybe dive into what you've built
so far? And perhaps, you know, where you plan to go, like, what, what
is the day look like? And what are you focusing on in the next like,
two months?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">p–e
 13:56  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Absolutely.
So right now, we, we've built kind of three main things. One is a set
of vaults that are feeding into the yield aggregation piece. And we
have vaults right now on test net, that allow people to invest in
protocols like Jedi swap eckbank. protocols like realms, some of
those are built by us. Some of those are featured by us. Or, you
know, for example, the the realms, Walt is one where the team used
our template to basically build a staking wallet. But we're also very
happy to feature it from our website, because we, you know, our goal
is to basically expose as many opportunities as possible to users
that that makes sense. The second piece is the keeper network. And so
the keeper network allows smart contract developers to automate their
transactions. And that's live on testament as well and we have been
supporting a number of defi projects in games like most notably
topologies eyesight game which is a, it's a very heavy ask. Their
updates are very frequent, you know, once every two blocks. And so
it's been, you know, awesome to see such an ambitious project. And
super, super stoked to be able to power it. And then the third piece
is the template. So we believe heavily in the ERC 466 standard, which
is an extension of ERC. 20 is basically a more generalised type of
token that describes yield bearing assets, right. And it's
effectively yield bearing assets with a single underlying acid. So
for example, you could have a ERC 4626 token that has ether as the
underlying acid. And that basically just means that, you know, it's
doing something with that ether, it's maybe investing in somewhere
getting some sort of interest rate. And there's some way of
depositing and withdrawing ether back. And so we're super excited
about that standard as a, you know, shape revolves to calm and we've
built a template on GitHub, that's also available to people to do use
and build work. So that's, that's our kind of therapy's.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Nostra
 16:02  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Nice.
Yeah. I mean, LC for six to six was quite a, made quite a big wave
earlier this year. And yeah, backed by a few popular popular apps on
on Aetherium. So it's nice that it's been sort of, you know, I guess,
transposed into into the stock net ecosystem?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">p–e
 16:23  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">For
sure, yeah. There's, there's something about, you know, starting it
that allows, I think, abstractions to be built at a smaller cost,
right. So, for example, on Main net, it would, it would be hard to
envision somebody creating an interface for interacting with ATMs in
a general way, right? Because the cost of an ATM transaction was
already significant. So the idea of someone building a layer on top
to kind of aggregate across, you know, different ATMs seems really
difficult. However, on Stark net, we don't really pay much for these
kinds of abstractions, right? Because all that matters is the
underlying storage changes at the end of the day. And so I think it's
even cheaper to use your SSI for six to six on Stark net, because,
you know, you can design in a very careful way, where you're not
really creating data, traditional storage on top of, you know, the
underlying protocol that you're, you're building on top of so that's,
that's, you know, one of the reasons why I think it's, you know, we
should definitely really heavily invest in push push towards
standards and actually explore standards that may be, you know,
prohibitive on Main net, but actually, on stockinet, they're entirely
valid, because they're just very lightweight.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Nostra
 17:30  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Agreed,
I mean, you know, that the more standardisation we have, the more
composability and optimum, optimal composability, the opportunities
we can create, between between protocols between contracts, solely
really just wanted to talk about sort of, you mentioned, perhaps the
possibility of, you know, rating, a, an audit. And kind of like this
unchained learning type of feature, Could you perhaps expand on how
you think that could be applied in, in vaults?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">p–e
 18:05  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Absolutely.
So yeah, going forward, we definitely want to start building up these
kind of high level aggregation features. In particular, I think, one
very simple way to get there is this field called online portfolio
selection. And it basically studies a theoretically, you can have a
very clearly defined problem, which is, you have a set of funds, and
typically these are kind of stock portfolios, but actually applies
really, really well to just smart contract wallets as well. And then
you observe every epoch which could be, you know, day month, or
whatever your time frame is, you observe the returns from the
previous period. And then you make a reallocation decision where you
say, okay, based on what I know already, and based on the returns
that I've observed in the previous period, let's say last day, I can
make a reallocation decision and maybe pull out a little bit money
from from one vault and put it into another. And I kind of went very
deep into the literature. And most of the algorithms, unfortunately,
are very storage, you know, the debate costly in terms of storage,
but but there's a few that are fairly elegant and lean. And so that's
a very exciting direction, I do want to implement them. There's
algorithms that basically can, can can kind of make those decisions
autonomously just by observing returns, but also, not forgetting
previous returns, right. So there's a way of basically compressing
the storage, you know, so instead of, let's say, remembering, you
know, in the past 90 days, like what was the return of every single
vault that's in the kind of yield aggregator there's a way of like,
compressing those returns into sort of a single number and
maintaining that. So that's kind of one direction that allows to, you
know, optimise the vault based on returns. I think when it comes to
smart contract reads, that's much harder to quantify. Obviously, I
think most protocols, as you've alluded to, like seem to just resort
to basically having a kind of a blanket inclusion have like, okay,
you know, if we feel like this protocol is audited? And if we feel
like it's carefully developed, then yes, we'll consider it. And if it
isn't, then we'll simply just won't add it. And I think there's ways
of making that a little bit more grey rather than black and white.
And, you know, for example, if you start to have smart contract
insurance, you can then have some versions of implied risks, right?
Because the more expensive insurance than surely the more the market
is deeming the smart contract risk to be a bit higher. Right. So I
think there's going to be interesting ways to proxy those risks going
forward, although, it's probably going to take a little while for for
those things to be mature markets on, on on stock, or have kind of
more mature, you know, smart contract risk articles or anything like
that. But, you know, super interesting to explore going forward.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
absolutely. I mean, I think that the the ability to store, you know,
more empirical data, you know, competent and, you know, apply
computations on that for you. So manage your portfolio rebalancing,
etc, is very smart and interesting. I don't think that sort of ml
machine learning type of approach has been really, really explored,
and probably, primarily because of the computational load that it
will take or just be far too costly on on something like main net,
where, you know, this is where Stark net almost shines in, in in the
world. So it's definitely exciting to see what will be your kind of
you've I think you've wrote something about Stark net, or Cairo
versus solidity? Can you give us a bit of a, your, your TLDR on, you
know, your thoughts? And, and why Cairo is is, is, you know, a nice
language and, you know, can be bring bring the next wave of
innovation into blockchain?</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">p–e

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
absolutely. I think, I think, yeah, the kind of common critique of
Cairo goes, you know, hey, we have this language called solidity, it
works really well, um, we shouldn't deviate from it. You know,
everyone knows it's suboptimal. But, you know, there's kind of so
much written in solidity right now that, you know, we should just
keep building on top of that, and really, you know, bending over
backwards to make sure that we figure out how to integrate solidity
into new systems, rather than, you know, inventing your programming
language. And then when they see Cairo syntax, they go, Oh, well,
this doesn't even seem better than solidity. Right, in terms of
ergonomics and things like that. I think the latter piece is
changing. I think Cairo is seeing some very interesting, you know,
syntax upgrades, I don't think that's what makes it, you know,
ultimately strong. What makes it strong, I think is basically, it is
a language that is very native to a certain type of architecture that
allows, you know, zero knowledge proofs. You know, the the kind of
simple distinction is, you know, solidity is a language that's really
great for, you know, writing safe, composable smart contracts, in a
network where people validate transactions by executing them, right.
But now, if we want to kind of move away from that paradigm into a
network where people validate transactions by just checking proofs,
it turns out that it's much more difficult to make the solidity
architecture, or the Etherion, virtual machine architecture work. And
so the two approaches, you know, snarks and Starks, they have
different trade offs. Starks, I think so far, theoretically, and
also, so far, practically seem to be more scalable, but they they
come with a limitation, which is, they are really hard to adapt to a
more traditional architecture. Because, you know, in order to create
a stock proof, you basically have to kind of take the programme,
you're gonna trace, and then convert it into a set of equations. And
those equations operate, you know, in a finite field, which is kind
of mathematically a word for basically saying that, you know,
division doesn't work the way we think it does. If you divide three
by two, instead of getting one, you get, like some really large
number. And what Cairo does is simply says, well, instead of trying
to, you know, abstract that away and building all that into the
compiler, let's just just give people these polynomial equations,
let's just, you know, allow people to work directly with that, and
see what they can build. And I think this is a really smart approach,
because what we've seen in maintenance specifically, is that we
started off with people being really excited about what you can do
with solidity and trying all sorts of things. You know, three, four
years ago, we had people building order books, people were building
lending protocols that had innumerable loan books, right. VCDX being
one example. People were doing all sorts of things that today would
just be very cost prohibitive. And what happened over the years is
that the most advanced solidity developers learn how to write an
assembly, they basically are not able to benefit from the higher
level features in language anymore. They had to build up so much
special knowledge to go a level deeper, and basically programming
you'll, I think, open seas, you know, latest protocol is the perfect
example of that where we've really gone to a world where the entire
contract can be written and you'll. And what that means is that
performance really matters. And now Kairos starts to look a lot more
attractive, because we're actually not comparing it with solidity
anymore. We're comparing Cairo to writings, you know, you'll or EVM
assembly. And I think Kira is a lot more powerful, right, and
actually a lot more high level, yet is probably gonna be able to
exhibit even better performance than being on Main net and writing
assembly. So that's ultimately what makes me really excited about
Cairo. I think it's the, it's probably going to be you know, that
language as suddenly has been for composable computing into kind of
this new paradigm of provable computing.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
thanks, Pete. Really appreciate your thoughts. I mean, I've been to a
couple of stock net events, meetups, what have you, and you do get
the very, sort of early early vibes from from that, you know, that a
lot of people are, you know, in the working at low level, working at
trying to, you know, improve the inchyra and the tools around it. And
so I just got this feeling that so early, similar to perhaps solidity
in its early days, that he hasn't really the true power hasn't been
explored yet. So a good few years to really see the benefits of that.
Just kind of to tie this up a little bit. Let's understand what what
does the next year look like for for Yagi? What's your? What's your
vision? What's on your vision board for Yagi? 2023?</font></p>

 26:40  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
so I think the main thing is, you know, bringing volts to main net,
and, and also sequencing in the way that we really allow, you know, a
lot more liquidity to be brought over to kind of emerging projects
and stark net, right. We want to make sure that, you know, whether
it's going to be blending protocols, whether it's going to be, you
know, stable swap AM's whether it's going to be options, protocols,
whether it's going to be you know, some entirely new ideas that are
going to, you know, have have some really interesting economics, that
we have vaults in place at the right time, so that users can actually
enjoy those opportunities. And, and those protocols can grow very
quickly. That's the main priority. Underneath that, I think, if we
have a couple of vaults that are really successful on Main net, we
really want to push into this sort of direction of aggregation and
starting to build more user friendly products, where you can just
pick whatever token your funds are in, you can deposit and you can
get exposure to all these L two yields on stock net. And I think one
immediate step we're kind of making towards that is that we're
spinning up a kind of contributor community. People have been
reaching out and saying, Hey, I would love to build a Yagi vault.
Connect, can I do that? And how would that work? And I think we're
trying to figure out how that looks like. And that's a really
exciting path, I think that can allow us to make sure that we can
continue to, to build because, honestly, you know, earlier earlier
this year, I had to really look for protocols that were even live on
test net, or have some form of yield that we could we could wrap into
and I think right now the that's starting to shift into a world where
it's hard to keep up. And there's there's there's new and exciting
things being developed. I mean, nostre is a great example, right? He
just announced the stable coin, delighting protocols coming along
really nicely. That's, that's a lot of exciting things to work with,
and figure out how to package to users. So I think and network of
people building wallets, and really empowering people to do that and
receive, you know, fees. I think it's gonna be be, you know, very
important for the protocol. In terms of in terms of other things, the
keeper network, you know, I think we also exciting to put that on
Main net and see where that goes, you know, what are the economically
sustainable use cases for keepers? I'm pretty sure that you know, not
every game is going to be able to afford to run on automation every
two blocks, you know, we're probably going to see kind of a narrowing
down of use cases on gaming. But but but I think a lot more use cases
on defy, where we're going to be able to see the keepers to work
across rebalancing positions or rebasing protocols, or helping with
upkeep and so on. But I think one area in gaming, which I think there
will play a role and perhaps a bigger role than it has been on a main
possible and main net is in the area of, of personal automation,
right? I think on Main net transactions are so expensive that keepers
are typically used by smart contract teams. versus actually on Stark
net, it's possible that users will want to run automations on their
own behalf. So for example, if there is you know, a game with an X
Writing kind of Gamefly economy, perhaps users will figure out some
sort of farming strategy, where, you know, they make certain types of
actions every day, and then, you know, optimise their, their kind of
resources and their decisions in a certain way. And, and they may be
able to tap into Yagi automation to do that. I think that's really
interesting to see just just just how far constructions performance
is gonna take us in terms of discovering new use cases on that front.
And, of course, you know, the definitely interested in kind of
continuing to push on the UFC for six to six standard, potentially
making extensions to that standard, as well, as we see fit, I think
it's a standard that we all have to nurture and develop, it's not
obvious, you know, how it will integrate into different things. I'm
really excited about seeing the force, the force six to six standard
being integrated into, you know, linear pools, hmm, I'm excited to
see integrate it into potentially lending protocols, right to be used
as collateral. I'm excited to see it integrated into, you know, other
other types of investment protocols that maybe, you know, exploit the
exchange rate feature that every year see for six to six volt has.
And I think that that may lead to kind of new types of extensions and
redefinition of what the appropriate interfaces and, and invariants
are for those types of contracts.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">But
yeah, I mean, ultimately, as a, as a yield aggregator, we, by its
nature, we have to be fairly responsive, it's very hard to predict,
you know, what are gonna be the best sources of yield, you know,
three months into, into Maine that six months into mainnet. So our
job right now is just to sort of set us up for success, build
infrastructure, continue to build out the UI. So it's really easy to
use, you know, but also start to figure out like, what type of
resources we need, what kind of team we need to be able to build out
all the opportunities are emerging.</font></p>

have this sort of, like, three months until the Regenesis. And it's
like a the the big sort of D Day and yeah, we have time and we're all

you know, eager to think seriously about that. And, and maybe we
should have our own live stream. I think it's like, it's gonna be as

yeah, we have a Twitter spaces. Next Monday. I think it's at 1130.
London to however that translates to your local time. So if you if
you have some time, feel free to join us. Where because they've a bit
more into into, you know. Alright. I think, Peter, I think that's

But in terms of Yagi, it's yagi.fy is the website. And then Yagi
underscore FY. Is our socials. And yeah, feel free to join the
discord. We're really excited to see people, you know, either that
wants to become contributors, and maybe, you know, interested in
building smart contracts. I think it's I think building a vault is
the perfect thing for someone who's maybe done a few only desk
contributions, done something really light and wants to kind of have
a stepping stone to maybe building a bigger project, but still get
rewarded for it. And then I think from from a user perspective, we'll
we'll do our best to make sure that Yagi is a place where people can
go and discover you know, all the great defi protocols on starkness.
So you know, if you're interested in in also, you know, investing in
instructing protocols when the time comes when when main it is really
seriously live. I would a lot of funds then then it's another reason
to join our Discord and follow along.</font></p>
