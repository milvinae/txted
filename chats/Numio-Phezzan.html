<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">All right, how's it going everybody
Hello, hello. Can you hear me I can hear you loud and clear as well.
How are you doing today? Excited waiting for this? Or yeah,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I'm doing well can't complain days
just getting started over here give it another minute or two while we
let some people join in and then we can we can get started</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">is there anybody else from your
team that you'd like to get added as a speaker? Or will it just be
yourself?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 2:20&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah, I think Roland can request.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 2:23&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Alrighty. So if you are there,
please, please request the mic. And I will add you as a speaker.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Roland&nbsp; 2:45&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Guys is Roland from Phezzan. Hello,
hello. Yeah, Jack would do the most of the talking today. I'm just
here to listen and see how things go.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 2:59&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome. Sounds good. I appreciate
you joining.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Roland&nbsp; 3:03&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Thank you. How did it go is mean
squared?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 3:06&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">A pretty good, you're gonna be
chatting with them a little bit. One of the things that we're one of
the things that we're looking at personally is getting some API's for
CK sync 2.0 and stark net. So we can basically grab different types
of metadata for NF t's on layer two. Right now there really isn't any
for that, for that for the most part. So that's definitely something
that we're looking into. Once those once those go live. So</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Roland&nbsp; 3:44&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">some great if you guys can just
exhibit NFCs from Minnesota, that's gonna be something huge.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 3:50&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah, that would definitely be,
that'd be great. I, I just want to be able to grab that type of data.
So we can, people can essentially view and manage that information in
the future. So</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Roland&nbsp; 4:02&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">yeah, if you asked about it, we are
trying to like build our project on them. I think they're also
requesting our metadata. So I think metre square will have all that
information for all the projects this over there. Okay, cool. Yeah,
so that yeah, that's just say like, no need to reinvent the wheels.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Unknown Speaker&nbsp; 4:20&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah, that makes sense. Awesome.
Well, I think we we can probably start start things up here and more
people will probably join in as as we continue on. But in any case,
let's, let's kick this thing off. So thank you everybody for joining.
My name is Mark and set. I'm one of the cofounders of new MEO and if
you aren't familiar with what new Neo is, it is a noncustodial mobile
wallet on Ethereum. So you can buy sell trade invest into crypto, but
our primary focus is giving you the best experience on layer two We
were the first bullet to natively support ZK roll ups first and
zkSync and our goal is to essentially build in support for a variety
of z k roll up solutions for you to use. But today we are not going
to be talking about new Mio. We are going to be talking about
Phezzan. Am I actually saying that correctly? Is it for Zhan or
Lizanne? Or how do you how do you pronounce it correctly?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 5:30&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Phezzan</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 5:31&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Phezzan okay. Yeah. So we are here
to talk about Phezzan and we have two of their team members. And
without further ado, I will hand the mic over to you all. So please
give us a quick little introduction about yourself. And then we'll
jump into what you're working on.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Unknown Speaker&nbsp; 5:52&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Oh sure. I'm Jack I'm along with
everyone we are to funders present political Sophie's in is a order
book based Propecia decks and retailers can be obese our index. So
first, like what is perpetuals there are a lot of new people here. So
for Petros, it is ultra thin thetic contract that closely tracked
this bulk price. So when you're trading for Petros, you're now buying
the underlying asset, you're just trading a contract. So why invent
the contract at all, so why just don't buy the spot. So the main
benefit is, with perpetuals, you can either go long, or go short. On
a spot, you can only go long. Also on perpetuals, you can have very,
very high leverage, I think by Nance today provides 125x leverage. So
you can trade as if you have a lot of a lot more money on your hand.
So that's very attractive. For these two reasons. Propecia today
takes around like 70% of volume for total amount all crypto markets.
So yes, they have a higher volume, guest spots, higher volume than
options, etc. They're like how does a perfect stranger works. So for
traders is very simple. Any perfect exchange, you can either go long
or go short. You can also choose your leverage. And perpetual
exchange has a mechanism called like funding payments. So every once
in a while, depending on whether you're long or short, you need to
pay or receive a funding payments. So perpetual exchange use this
mechanism to make the market price more closer to spot price.
Finally, perpetual exchange has something called an insurance fraud.
So what interests found is does is make sure like the perpetual was
exchanges stay liquid. It doesn't go right. So that's how alcohol
works.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 7:56&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Very cool. Interesting. And so I
guess with a perpetual exchange, obviously, you guys are building it
out in a noncustodial manner. I believe I believe you're building it
in the non custodial manner. Just before I continue with the question
is, is that correct?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Unknown Speaker&nbsp; 8:17&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Oh, yes, so I'd like to all users
assets, there will be a trade saved on here. But like we have like
our own Automation Engine right now, like it happens like often we
will eventually move it to entre like oh assets on chain like all
trace that settles on chain</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 8:34&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">data, okay. And for people who are
like let's say like you're an LP Are there going to be like both am
FM's as a part of your decks as well as order books or are you going
to have just an order book associated with your decks? And for like
LPS would they be experiencing like any type of impermanent loss when
providing liquidity?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 9:08&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Sure, so surance there is no
present right now is it Amen, but like it will soon shift to like
older book model we are building for and pure audiobook decks. So
like, what is the new permanent loss anyway? So if you new to this,
in criminal losses, basically when you provide liquidities on any mm
based exchange, unless the price comes back to the price you provide
liquidity for, like you're better off, just like no LP. So that's
like, an issue like oh, and memes have. There are a lot of smart
people in the world solving this like, unfortunately, the issue
hasn't been solved now. On this issue, like, I think uniswap People
did research like a month ago, or 19 most popular coins, most popular
markets, only three of them. three golden LPs are making money. So
that's impermanent. It's very bad for LPS. But like on a book, like,
there's no impairment loss. So knowing permanent stock is an.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 10:11&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Interesting. Okay, cool. And do you
have sort of like a timeline in terms of when you're going to be
transitioning from an amm into an order book?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 10:22&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">To be honest, we started up I think
there's no exact time, but we will launch our Yeah, we enter launch
on manage, like, this year.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 10:31&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay, very cool. Awesome. And I,
what are what are some of the ways that you're looking to sort of
differentiate yourself from some of these other ducks that are
essentially in the market? And would you say it's more so on like,
the purpose side of things or just within like the actual experience
with the, with trading, in general.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 10:59&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So what we do is that we are on a
vote base per Dex, but we also allows retail liquidity. So compared
to all of our indexes, we, since we allow like retail liquidities, we
can have like, we can afford a lot of volatile assets. Because today
like almost all of our base, Texas, they are depend on market makers,
market makers, they don't want to like trade these volatile assets,
because it's risky. But retail LP that data mine. So for this reason,
we can offer like volatile coins, like you can trade April and GMT on
dydx. But like we do that, because then you can do it. So that's a
benefit. And compared to mmm is like one is that we don't have any
impairment loss. So it's better LP experience. LPS can earn more
money and ended up for traders, we have like, more slippage, because
like order book, they are more capital efficient.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 11:56&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Interesting. Okay, cool. And one of
the things that that I was sort of looking into on your documentation
page, is there's there's a few different types of strategies, or I
should say, trading strategies to be more specific that people can go
and essentially deposit into. And I guess, like, you can consider
them like market making strategies. Could you touch on that a little
bit more? Is that something that other people, like? Let's say like,
if I'm like, I'm a quant trader, and I can go and deploy, like a
strategy that I have, like, let's say like, I'm Allergy Research,
run, jump? And are there like different types of like, market makers
that can get involved that other users can then deposit into? Or is
it something completely different from that?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 12:56&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I think that's right. Correct. On
so okay, like, yeah, like we said, like prison is a holodeck allows
retail liquidity. We allow you to liquidity by like, introducing our
like liquidity marketplace. So inside our liquidity marketplace,
anybody can upload this tripster strategies, market making
strategies, like without any permission. And so like, once it's
uploaded, we show on website, hey, we'll show to our users. Hey,
these are different kinds of strategies, what they're TVO is like,
what their API is, what's the strategy about with developers so it
will be very clear to retail LP like whether this strategy is like
attractive or not. So if they're interested they can put money into
it and so the money will be store I totally don't care it's
noncustodial and like, market making bolts, these treasuries like can
use the money from these retail LPs to mark and make like on behalf
of these LPS so that way is that market making eye on fees and
protocol is as easy as market making on like uniswap So this is a
nother case before fees Am I because I'm most I think right now I'm
on a book base Texas on like you can't if you don't know how to
programme you just can't like Mark and make just because a very
complicated to market make on audiobooks.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 14:27&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Wow, that's really cool. Okay,
interesting. And then so then the, I would imagine that a lot of the
people who are making these market making strategies like would they
be getting, like carry on profits or just like commission on like,
funds that are deposited or how is that sort of able to be
customised?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 14:52&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So, hello, yes. Like, these
strategies make money like we will distribute like the profit I have
the strategy to the structure owners, and like these, these owners
can determine themselves Hey, how do I how can I how should I like
distribute these like p&amp;l As to the liquidity providers. And so,
each different structure owner can choose their own different profit
sharing mechanisms. And these mechanisms will be totally on chain. So
anybody can is very transparent, or a piece can see, hey, how do I
get my p&amp;l? So, yes, proper, these actually owners can get a cut
from the profit. And the rest of the section will be distributed to
the liquidity providers. And like also, other than, like pianos,
these liquidity providers can also get like, a cut from the trading
fees. And like, they may get some rewards like for for present token
as well. So, yeah, that's our Hello ha works.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 15:56&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay, very cool. And so I guess,
would you guys be considered in the same realm as like competitors,
or like, I don't know if I would necessarily call you guys
competitors. But with with set protocol, because like I, I was one of
the first contributors over at at index Co Op. And they're like, I
don't want to say a similar asset management tool. But that's, I
would say definitely more focused for indices. And this is probably
just more like, Dex trading focused for the most part. I don't know
if you're able to, like, explain a little bit more some how some of
the ways that you guys are looking to sort of differentiate there.
From those types of protocols.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 16:44&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yep. So like, these type of
protocols like set, they are essentially the Arctic assets management
tools. They are a golfer, instructor product, to the customers, like
monkeys and political. Yes, we have our liquidity marketplace. You
can like choose different strategies. But like, our main goal here to
present is a liquidity marketplace, just service our index like we
are indexed. Yeah. Growth. Yep. So this is a means to an end, like,
with these retail liquidity with the liquidity marketplace, we can
have the more liquidity to our index. That's a goal. So like I said,
you know, we are decks and but like, there are some concepts, they're
the same. That is like for each treasure owners, you can imagine them
as like a separate hedge fund on Yes, retail these can choose at
which hedge funds like they trust, like they found like his phone has
a high API, they can just put money into it, they can yield very
happy. So yes, for from that aspect is pretty similar.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Roland&nbsp; 17:50&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Also, may I add one more thing? Of
course, go for it. Yeah.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So from our perspective, like, we
think in the future, when FISA is big enough, actually, we can
integrate with protocols like set, right? Why? Because there will be
1000s of strategies out there. And set will be the inert for the
traditional finance or transfer metaphor. Set will be the Flf fund
funds or funds. So as a credit provider, or retail op, you're not
really familiar with strategies, you don't even know how to shoot,
you go to set right set well, in some extent, choose the source and
figure out what's the best liquidity priority strategy for you, and
then use that you don't even maybe you don't even use the filter
itself, but you're still providing liquidity for fism. Does that make
any sense?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 18:41&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yes, no, that definitely makes
sense. Very cool. Okay. Awesome. And so right now, would you say
like, obviously, I don't believe you guys. Were on Main net just yet.
And that you're still on test net? Is that correct? You're still on
that. You're still on test net?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 19:04&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yes. Okay. Cool.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 19:06&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So I guess with that, like, how is
husband the process for you all building on on Z casing, but what's
the what's your experience been with that? And I guess deploying the
test net and what makes you sort of excited about I guess the next
couple months are gonna bring?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 19:27&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah, sure. So it's certainly very
interesting experience because Ziggy's think at this point. It's
interesting to panel. It's a very early stage. It's like it sounds
so. So like when we try to deploy our code like he gets into but oh,
we had a lot of issues like competitive competitor issues, and some
of them it's like, because their competitors are so like a beta
product. So it's, it's coming in ways that we help each other To like
in the process, or when we are going to deploy on z gets into Moodle.
And like, do you guys think King is amazing, they are very fast, they
give a help to us. Also, like, biggest thing, community is awesome.
We have a lot of awesome community members, they are excited about
like Zika coupon or as excited as we are. So that's like, young
Amazings he gets in to meetings, he gets in community gets very
excited. And like once we launch, once he gets into below, we finally
got our trust, transaction speed is coming very fast. And the gas for
you just go down so fast and cheap. That's the thing that traders
care about. So very awesome. And I think, um, I think the final thing
is that we are very bullish on the ecosystem of like xinxing
coastside. They are like ZKU n, where it's very easy to migrate over
from L ones to DK sync without changing your code. You can like we
deploy also at contract, like without much trouble. And yeah, so we
can imagine like in the future, there would be a lot of great daps a
lot of great projects. We already talked to a bunch of great
projects, like onboarding, Zeke is so very, very bullish on Zeke is
future.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 21:25&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome, love to hear it. What are,
were you guys exploring deploying on other ecosystems? When you guys
were basically putting together the concept for the project? And if
so, like, what were some of the other I would say like networks or
ecosystems that you guys were looking at, to deploy into?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 21:46&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah, we look into a bunch. But
like, our final conclusion is that we are like most bullish on ZTE.
VMs. Because we are bullish on Eve. Most users here like most liquid
is here. Most great progress here. And like, monitor all these ease,
like layer twos. The thicker you guys make more sense for us, because
the cheap and fast they are like autism like arbitrary. And like, in
like a month difference. zero ops, we choose to launch on decreasing
first. Because like, they support like old version of solidity that's
important to us. So it's really important a lot of projects. So yeah,
by doing that, we believe, like there will be like tonnes of good
projects onboard into these into well, that's like how a process we
choose like CVS in cueball.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 22:39&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome, very cool. Yeah. I know
many, many people, including myself, are eagerly waiting for for that
to go live. It's going to be gonna be really exciting. So I guess, I
guess with that being said, like, what are what are some of the other
things that you all have on your roadmap for design? Like, is there
anything that people can keep an eye out for any exciting
announcements that you all can share? Or, or anything like that, we'd
love to hear like some of the things for people to sort of look out
for over the next few weeks over the next couple of months, and maybe
something to look for a few months down the road.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 23:27&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Sure. So I think the next major
thing is that we will issue our own antes. So we will issue like,
spacebar and I teach you initially to like our contributors, we have
like many awesome contributors, in our community, they recorded all
the bugs, and they record a lot of good feedback, they help us like
in promoting his own protocol like translating our articles, like we
are really amazed by our communities. So like NF t will be a way to
contribute to for them i to reward for them. And like these like
empty can be used like maybe like in the future user we can get a
discount, right? When trading bounties and protocol. There are more
and more utilities we can think about but we will like AirDrop these
like NF T's in think in the future, like shooting the future. And
then then next up is like we will launch on our order book on test
that we are stoked to do over here. And we are in like thinking go
progress regarding to launch and order book. So yeah, so after that a
little book, it's like, like bug testing and audit then we hopefully
we can launch the minute. Like whenever it is it is in the launch
there a minute. So yeah, and that's roughly for the like Things we
plan to do like destiny. And like after all these games like
liquidity marketplace we talked about and a bunch of other things.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">That's exciting. That's really
exciting. So I'm definitely very curious about what's going on with,
I guess, like the auditing process. Are you guys mainly? For a lot of
the projects that are I guess I would say like deploying on to the
casing 2.0? Are you guys having those audits done natively in
solidity? Are you doing that? In zinc as well? Because I actually,
that's actually a question. I haven't really asked anyone that's
actually building smart contracts. So kind of kind of curious on I
guess, like the the approach there.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 25:47&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Oh, that's really good question. So
what's very special about Zika seem to employ is like you can just
like, deploy you like solidity code without writing anything. That's
like, why it's called like z given? Yeah, so like, our contract right
now is 100% based on busying, like solidity. So like, when when you
go on it, it will be like, like, if nothing changed, yeah, it will be
100% inside it, which is awesome.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 26:14&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Very cool. Awesome. That's
exciting. So I think this is a good time for us to essentially open
up questions from the community. So any, any questions that you all
have, that I that I might not have asked, feel free to jump in,
request the mic. If you aren't aware, you can only really do that if
you're on your mobile device. So if you want to ask a question, click
on the button in the bottom left hand corner that says Request to
speak. And you can then ask your question. So I'll give it give it a
little bit while you guys can think about some questions and then we
can start to wrap things up from here. Right, give it another 2030
seconds and then we'll go from there. Well, all right. Seems like I
might have we got one person. Okay. There we go. All right. Chessy,
the floor is yours. Please make sure to unmute your mic, and then you
can feel free to to ask any questions. Yeah.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Hi, everyone. I'm just interested
in what's the team behind says and maybe you can share a bit about
your background? What have you done before? Starting fism?</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 28:34&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah, so like, we are a and I must
seem like because we want to let the product speak for itself. So
yeah, like we will also share more but we decided to say that the
product speaks for itself. Thanks for the question.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Mark Anstead&nbsp; 28:58&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I guess I have a sort of a follow
up question on that. So obviously, like your team is anonymous at the
moment do you plan to remove that anonymously? Or are you planning to
stay anonymous throughout like the tenure of building facade</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Phezzan&nbsp; 29:17&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">so we can speak like that for
future plans because know what nobody knows to be future we can
assure they're like power like past story. So like before doing this
we are like our team made a social app it's like yes sir distribution
app and made to like top 100 spots in Apple App Stores like social
networking category. And like we been like our funding team have been
like a long one term traders in crypto. So like, we are really
intuitive exes and we are really intuitive crypto trading. So we see
like, when we are starting like is that protocol we try to constant
access we see there's like what's the issue is like we talked about
are there issues. So like is that Is there a way to like, fix the
issue? And to really bring, like, we want to build the best access?
And the other thing is like, when ever like in the future, like, if
we face like some, like severe, like, say, one problem get hacked,
etc. Yes, I mean, this will be a good time for us to, like stand out
because like, yeah, like we want to, like, have like ownership being
in like, whatever issue we have on boats, like it was fine. I mean,
maybe it's better just Dianna. But yeah, and like if anybody who know
who wants to, like know who we are like, we are really welcoming you
to like just DMS, like maybe Twitter or discord. Like, we will love
to chat with you. So we, there are a couple of committees coming in,
