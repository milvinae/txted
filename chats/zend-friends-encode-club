I think we are at the hour and have a decent crowd going on. I think
we will have more people joining us as time goes on as time goes. And
without further ado, why don't we get started. So hello, everyone.
Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening to you all. This is Brian
from Scikit. Learn and I will be your host for today's AMA. Today's
for today's AMA. We're very lucky to have Yasin and Laura with us to
speak a bit more about encode club. I'm sure a lot of you would have
know a little bit from my primary Twitter or also, I'm looking at
their website, which is very informative. And we I mean, for the next
hours, we want to ask a little bit more about how this programme has
structured direction of how encode club it's going to go and see if
there are any insights or else we can take from this. So Laura and
Yasin wanted to pass the stage to you for a brief introduction about
your background, how you got started with crypto, and eventually your
journey all the way to encode right now. Do you mind giving us a
quick introduction?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
absolutely. My name is Yasiin and welcome all very happy to have you
around. For for the studio spaces. Appreciate your time. I am a
graffiti ENCODE. I've been in the position since the beginning of
this year. Been at a software company for the past 10 years as a
project manager mostly and then a a product one mostly with mobile
app development. I've been into crypto since 2017 When mostly the ICO
hype started to build up it was quite a lot of new information being
thrown around is quite interesting at the time as well. So it was a
lot of learning and it was very puzzling at the very beginning and
yeah then the first bear market hidden not really the first one but
the first one at least I had the experience so through during that
time I I still kind of like kept up reading and accumulating
information and getting deeper into everything that's happening in
the web three world really. And yeah, just recently as I said in the
beginning of the year I knew about encode from for some time mostly
since the very inception since I know founders really well I've been
following them there was an opportunity for obviously incorporate
growing a lot at the time and decided to to make a change for my
career and move to a three full time I think Laura's having issues
with a mic</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
let me try it like this. Sorry about that. All right, while we wait
for Laura to pop back on, just want to drill in a little bit more, I
asked him for your experience. So wanted to see, what does a growth
lead does on a day to day basis? That's one and two, how does that
compare to your previous experience as a web two, project manager?
How to? How to find a different style, whether the experience are
transferable, or it's a totally new district that you're marching
into?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yasen.encode

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Um,
I would say that, I would say that it's quiet. Can you hear me? Yeah,
okay, perfect. Um, for me, it was, I think a lot of the skills that I
previously accumulated was still useful. Obviously, coming in from a,
from a, from within the tech industry helped a lot with assimilating
a lot of the new information that's been thrown around, and all the
new terms and everything and how the technology industry has evolved
ever since the inception of Bitcoin, that that kind of helped me with
kind of getting through the deeper waters of what we're three years
and how it functions. Other than that, on terms of what growth really
doesn't ENCODE, it's mostly BD. So business development, making sure
that we're in a great relationship with most of our partners and
ensuring that most of the programmes that we run with with them are
satisfying for both parties. So basically, getting to know to work
with pretty much all the protocols in the space. Since we're mostly
chain agnostic, we work we work with companies from both on the EVM
and unknown EVM side. And we've had the pleasure to work with pretty
much everybody within the space as up until now. And we're looking
into working with a lot of, of the new protocols that are coming up.
And hopefully the river a lot of interesting programming in the near
future.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Well,
that's one of the negatives of being decentralised and working from
home. If we were in office, I would have certainly helped her by now,
but not really sure what the issue is. But yeah, happy to happy to
answer some of your questions while she's handling her situation.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Sure,
sure. Let us know, when you when you pop back on, Laura, maybe we can
try to rejoin it a bit. And then let us know if that helps us out at
home. And then on our back end, we'll try and help you see how we can
deal with our speaker right again. So I guess my next question is for
ENCODE, what are the origin story? It's, it was found in 2020. It's
not actually a very old company, per se. How was it found? And what
kind of problem was or what what is the type of problem that it's
trying to solve? And has the business model and the aim evolve much
during the past two years through the different cycles?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yasen.encode
 18:40  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
so Well, in cotton was founded mostly during the bear market of 2018.
It was quite a different company back then. I mean, the way it
operated was a bit different in a way that it actually started with
doing mostly in person events. So we started off with working within
the UK with some of the top blockchain societies within the country,
organising a lot of hackathons and events. And just when things were
starting to get better and better, it's when COVID came in and, and
in surprise, pretty much everybody and affected. Absolutely every
industry out there, including including us. So when cold was actually
in a position where it had to adapt to the point where now everything
has moved online. And that has been, as I said, a blessing and a
curse really, because it is it was quite a challenge to find the
model to kind of scale everything that we were doing in a fully
online way. But since that was figured out, it ended up being one of
the best decisions mostly because it opens up to a global audience.
And now most of our all of our programmes really are. We're having
people from all over the world and the impact that we can we can
provide and the quality of our programmes is now reach ng is now
global in reaching everybody. So that has that has been that the DoD
airport, ENCODE was and how it evolved. And yeah, we even the goal of
providing as high quality programmes to people that are willing to
learn and want to come on board, Chrome Web two to three.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Brian
zkLend  20:21  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Interesting,
very interesting. And I understand and code, it's, like you said, a
changing state, and it's also wearing many hats. What I mean by that
it's, it's functioning as more of a education or, and also human
resource, platform, incubator, and also scaling agent for growing
protocols. of all functions, I'm not sure whether I cover all the
core functions, what do you think would be kind of the bread and
butter or the key features that ENCODE is relying on? And can you let
us know? What's your logic behind that?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yasen.encode
 20:56  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I
mean, the key feature will be probably the, the educational
programmes that we run, because I believe there are a lot of curious
people out there that just don't know where to start. And, as I said,
there's a lot of noise, and a lot of hard information that needs to
be kind of digested in order for for somebody to make their own mind
whether or not the industry is for them or not. So I think the the
kind of the whole different array of events that we that we kind of
conduct is a way for people to kind of ease into it through you get
to learn about different aspects and know more about everything on
the technical side as well, so that they can see what they can they
can fit in because obviously, crypto three are not not really easy
for a lot of people to understand. So our goal is to kind of simplify
it as much as we can and provide people with opportunities to, to
come in grow and achieve their goals.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Fascinating.
Okay, so when you mentioned that the education programme is the key
outreach Outreach Programme that supports the base layer of ankle
cuffs, so to speak, who are some of your key targets? For the
education programme? Would it be more moreso, a fat grant? Or was
that more catered towards work to web three, conversion, or more, so
a web three death kind of pivoting between projects.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yasen.encode
 22:30  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I
mean, it's not only education, because we are working with all people
with different type of backgrounds. And some of them are an entry
level others like people with more than 10 years of web developer
experience. And so everybody has a different background and different
pre existing knowledge. So not everybody, everybody's in for, you
know, learning something new, but the way they learn it is through
different type of programmes. So the educational series are mostly
meant meant for new newcomers people that are kind of like still
trying to explore what we're three in crypto is. But for people with
a bit more experience, so people that have had dealt in different
layer ones and trying to start new ones is are the ones that actually
will find a lot more value in being part of our hackathons. Since, as
I said, we, we pretty much work with pretty much everybody within the
space and from especially mostly l ones. If these these, these
programmes provide a huge amount of value for them. And as I said, we
have even accelerators, which are mostly for people that already have
great projects that themselves at the hands, people that are just
looking for the next step people that are looking to get into to, you
know, different companies that can support them, etc. So even the
boot camps that we run them also for people with way we much, much
higher level of understanding of programming and knowledge. So as I
said, all these programmes provide some sort of educational value for
participants, but it's on a completely different level for everybody.
So I would like to think of all of our programmes as complementary.
And like being part of more than one would shed a lot of light on way
what what your weak spots are and what your strengths are, which
would kind of push you in the proper direction, so that eventually
you end up at the right place.</font></p>

prompt, more permanent or established protocol. And what I've seen,
include participation in start, where and having a starting tech

a teammate themselves are in April. And then I think three months
later, you guys already have the hackathon in Paris already sold
them. So I think in terms of the speed of coming to the market and
being able to bring on this on new information, or even for layer
two, it's extremely fast and also having, for example, to seek a
bootcamp later on. In August, I think these are all a very good
Nation initiative for newcomers to understand what the new narratives
about and actually get involved in, ultimately connect the three
projects in the space.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">That's
okay. Maybe we'll move on first, and then try to resolve technical
issue in parallel. Okay, so when you mentioned about all the
different types of education programme from workshop to boot camp to
hackathon and accelerator going forwards, could you I mean, as a
lifecycle of a deal of developer getting started on web three, how my
day interact with, with ENCODE, and what will be the typical entry
point. And also just want to understand, as a human being coming in,
what will be my end goal from, let's say, going through workshops,
and about next steps for me.</font></p>

 26:41  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
that really goes back to what your previous background is, and where
you are in your web page journey. Obviously, if you're completely new
to everything, following the educational series, which are kind of
like the entry level for all of our programmes is kind of like the
best part really, because you get to experience and get to learn
about different protocols, different projects, and how different
technologies interact with each other, and why they matter and how
they differ. And what the impact is, on everything happening. And
with free space. So that will be the first level of like, where you
where you get to learn a lot more for people that are now for people
that are feeling more confident in their coding skills and things
that they have a preference towards an ecosystem, because obviously,
there are lots of a lot, lots of them out there. We usually that's
where we are why we have the hackathons. And they they are like a
fantastic stepping stone for them to kind of test their skills with
with people that are basically at their own level, their level. And
they they can try and build something for the duration of the
hackathon. Obviously, the online ones provide a lot more time for
them to do so over the course the online ones over the course of four
weeks. But the real actual tests happen for the input in hackathons
like the one we had with for starting in Paris, which was a weekend
hackathon, where you get, you have two days, you need to form a team,
especially if you're coming in alone. So there are a lot of
challenges to end up submitting something. And you don't even know
that yourself, because you guys had three teams there as well. So
it's not easy. But this is obviously like the step. The second step
for like people that know what they want to know what to pursue, in
terms of accelerators is kind of like the step further where you
believe you already have a team, you have something that you're
working on. And that's going to be the step that you would like to
take in a way that now you're you're in for for the for the next part
of your journey, which is learning more about what a fundraiser is
making sure that you're the project that you're working on is, is
kind of like working on polishing it, making sure that it's it's up
to the standards of like the top quality ones that we have in web
three. And last but not least, boot camps. The boot camps are really
one of our most, you know, I think, competitive programmes that we
run. And they're really really heavily oversubscribed. Mostly because
interest is huge. People want to learn people want to hone their
skills. And we run these online. And we have dedicated teachers for
these, which is something that we try to run differently than, you
know, you know, other competitors in the way that they approach
teaching. We try to do this in person as much as possible, where
people will be able to kind of learn from a teacher and have the have
the time to ask their own questions, submit their own projects, in
the end, work alongside others and learn from them. And hopefully by
the end they their skill level will be much higher for them to go
back into ecosystem in a way that they find appropriate without that
might be coming in for different hackathons or In the wrong project,
or moving to a company.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Excellent.
And actually, when you mentioned the overseas question of boot camps
and how competitive it is to kind of, I do have two questions to ask
you to ask two quick follow up question to ask on that. One, it's
understand for ankle the placement rates comparatively higher than
the other competitors across the space. And because I think one of
the attributes you get, you will have a very stringent screening
process for the bootcamp participant where you will test whether they
have the right skill set or experience prior to going and to get the
maximum benefit out of it. I understand that will be kind of
depending on to your programme to programme. Are these attributes
mainly going to be technical attributes or just want to understand
what would be kind of the screening criteria? You would you would
rate someone for potential success? Or in the programme?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yasen.encode
 31:00  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
well, there are multiple criteria that we were looking after. And
most of them obviously, the bar for participation is quite high. And
it is high for multiple reasons, mostly because we want to ensure
that everybody that is going to participate in the programme is, is
going to have an equally good experience with somebody else. We have
a lot of a lot of team projects, that has to be done throughout the
course of the curriculum, which involves working alongside others.
And if you're working with people with a different background and
knowledge, you end up having a bad experience, really, because not
everybody is able to pull their own weight. So we need to make sure
that the quality of the developers that are in that are accepted to
the bootcamp is high enough so that they can fully participate,
follow the teacher understand all the complex matters that are being
taught to them. So as I said, we from all this, all the applications
that we get, we usually go through the everybody's background, we
obviously expect people to have pre existing developer knowledge and
experience. We screened for this. And we obviously draw a line at
some point at which we then invite most of these people to do a one
on one calls with us. Our programme managers handle these, so that we
just want to make sure that the person is really committed to
participating. But even if somebody is not accepted for a bootcamp,
these people usually remain. We know pretty much everybody that has
been part of our programme and has applied to us. So if if we see
them participating in other programmes, such as hackathons, which are
open to everybody to attend, and they come back after a couple of
hackathons and try to apply to a boot camp, we already know, okay,
look at this, we did not accept this person for for one of the boot
camps, but ever since then they have been really driven to kind of
participate in you know, you know, make their own path forward, which
means that we can then give them a support seeing that, okay, maybe
we misjudged this person, because he created a couple of great
products from previous hackathons. So this person really deserves a
spot on one of our bootcamp. So this is kind of like an, even though
somebody sometimes gets, as I said, rejected, it's actually on the
long term, a big plus for them, because it just if they're there, if
they have the right kind of mentality, which plays a huge part as
well, they will eventually get to the place they want to be.</font></p>

Hi, hello. Good to good to hear you. All right after, after some
difficult time solving technical issues, despite us all working in

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">of
course. I'm so sorry about the technical issues. I didn't have the
most up to date version of the app. My problem. Hi, everyone. Thanks
for coming and really happy to be here. So a little bit about me. I
started my career as a kind of tech headhunter, based in London
working for predominantly kind of like different hedge funds and
financial Institute's helping kind of software developers, quant
developers find the next opportunities. And then from there I moved
towards kind of specific diversity headhunting so supporting more
women getting into technology, especially kind of like more senior
technical roles, as well as supporting brands kind of build their
image to the women in tech community. After that, I moved into kind
of the educational technology space. So working on basically what
encode does, but in web two for the biggest coding bootcamp. So
again, supporting people moving into the space, helping them kind of
carve out their career, and partnering with some great brands in
order to do that. So yeah, it just felt like a very natural move, to
take the experience that I had, and put that into crypto, and
supporting kind of mainly web two developers making their way into
web three, across predominantly kind of technical positions.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Understood,
yeah, I was gonna say, when I looked at encode a little bit more
initially, my first impression is that anko seems like a kind of a
bootcamp educator. And then what it feels like to work out, when I
want to read more about it, it's actually it's a very powerful
recruiting platform as well. I think the whole mechanism is very
organic, where you would have a participant from the space coming in.
And you would also have protocols and also other projects, prominent
one as well coming in, and also giving out tasks and also giving
lectures and being able to spot talent as they go and also mean
having them to work on part of the projects alongside before actually
onboarding. And I think the whole experience, it's everyone gains
value from it, not just for a row at the end, but I think from the
experience exposure and also connections, which is, I think, a really
powerful agent across the entire space. So yeah, so I think that's a
really well placed strategy for the entire ankle club. In the West,
Rotary equals ecosystem.</font></p>

100%. Yeah, I think the value of being able to work on projects in a
kind of blocking environment for people that are trying to break into
the space couldn't be better. I mean, doing a hackathon over a
weekend with a kind of big brand name. And then having a piece of
work to actually show to potential employers after that as well is
amazing.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yep,
yep. Okay, circling back on. My second question on the one of Yes,
Ins point about finding the right talent to head to boot camp, per
se, because some of these boot camps are projects that are very new
in this space, and they are leading in terms of technology, and in
terms of innovations. Obviously, partners are something that is
somewhat solid, something that partnerships are something that you
really need to keep expanding in order to have the resource for
instructor for curriculum and so forth. How do you build these type
of relationships and getting the right instructor for boot camps and
judges for hackathon given the the speed that the space is expanding?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Sure.
No, I was just saying that. For a lot of DOD boot camps, actually,
that covers a lot of the very leading technology or a fast growing
space, and new protocol or new layer as well. How do you strike
partnerships and being able to find the instructors or judges what
happened sign? And for example, your experience with starting it? How
did it all begin? Did you reach out to the software team and just
want to understand the mechanism behind it?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Not
really, because in terms of we've been blessed to have great teachers
with a really deep understanding of the model. So they have been
quite knowledgeable. Well, in advance, we'll before we actually
started working with Wittstock, were on everything's document related
and all of our programming, but it's been basically the interest that
we've seen from the beginning of all of our programmes that like the
whole, the huge, you know, influx of people are willing to learn more
about everything started related that actually pushed us into
exploring more and trying to deliver as more and more events. And so
far, we've been really happy with the results, both for for the GK
boot camps that we're doing, as well as all this documentary
programming. And I think that so far, it's been a success. And our as
I said, our teachers are evolving along the way as well. It's in
because the more the more we run these, the better the quality of
these books arms can be, obviously. So I think, yeah, I think we will
really find the right position and the right time with, with both
with both of our teachers having the right knowledge to kind of like,
be able to provide these programmes.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
are these teachers or instructors? Are they in house and code
employees? Or do you find find them helping to teach a course, just
for the period of time? And then while they are in between projects,
or they do have that time reserved for you guys, I mean, the reason I
ask this question is because from what I see on the website, there
are many, many boot camps being run or hackathons being run in
parallel. And in order to sustain this growth going forward, the
strain on talent, even for in house instructor, it's going to be
exponential going forward. So yeah, just want to understand a little
bit more on how that it's going to pan out.</font></p>

we work with them, we basically have a couple under current right
now. And they've been covering pretty much all the wood comes up
we're doing so obviously, there's a lot of strain on them. But we we
love these programmes, they love these programmes as well. So it's
mostly a question of time, really, and not whether or not we can do
more, we obviously like to do more, for the reason, because we see
how many people show up how many people are eager to learn. And we
know that our criteria are quite high. So even as, at the time
speaking, we actually trying to do a more, for an easier, an easier
course for the bootcamp, which would be more of an entry level one,
which is, again, going to be covered by the same teacher that we work
with. And I think that they will have a lot to handle and in the
upcoming months, but it's all for the cause of providing better
programmes, and allowing people to learn.</font></p>

I also want to reiterate your point that while seeking land was as a
partner with encode on both the started hackathon and also the CK
bootcamp. And from our experience that we have, we find it very
rewarding in terms of getting to know the new developers within a
communities, existing ecosystem partners. And also even for just
connection marketing purpose, and also getting the name out in the
growing space as well. What do you think would be some of the key
value proposition for new projects to partner with, and code in terms
of hosting a workshop or doing any sponsorship or coming in to help
out with the hackathon</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">it's
a relationship that goes both ways, really, because we're obviously
doing all of these programmes, because we rely on these programmes,
projects, they help us grow when we help them grow as well. And at
the same time, we're helping the stocking ecosystem grow as well,
well, through all of these programmes, and in terms of what what they
can expect, I think being involved and supporting one of these
programmes, puts you really, on the stage, it brings, as I said,
we've seen a lot of people come in the interest for all the
programmes that we organising, grows, after each and every one of the
programmes that we run. So it's not only an exposure, type of
involvement, so obviously, you, their projects will be noticed. But I
think there's a lot of quality developers that they get the chance to
network with a lot of new projects that they get to engage with, I
think being part of the project, being part of these programmes
basically, is like becoming part of the family that is the stuff in
the ecosystem. And I've said this multiple times before, like even
for the organisation of the the inputs and hacks on liquidity in
Paris, I was really amazed at how many people know each other in
advance. And it really felt like a family like everybody knew each
other for for a long time. And it was, it was really a nice thing to
observe and be part of, and we throughout the programmes that we are
planning to do in the near future. We Our goal was to kind of like
extend this to all of the other like future sponsors and projects
that we can help and give a stage to kind of like grow and, and
succeed.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
absolutely. I totally get what you feel by being a part of the
family. It's like a big family reunion where each time you would have
new members coming along and some of the existing all members that
you are acquainted with, they will probably introduce you to new
connections and new projects they're working with and the network
just keeps growing and having multiple multiple connections of
different different layers. So I think this is one of the very
rewarding experience from working with starting at the very
beginning. And moving and moving, I mean, changing gears a little
bit. One, I think the next question, I do want to cater more to
Laura, because we have seen a few different educator on web three
space where some of them use uses a slightly different model where
they might initially outsource programmes or also as job from
prominent projects to contribute to a list of tasks for the graduates
to take on to complete. And eventually, they might become a coin
contributor of the project get hired by the projects that way,
instead of during doing a proper boot camp or workshop programme per
se. What is your thought on this approach versus a kind of a direct
hire from recruitment pool approach?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">You
know, I think, very different. I think having people work on kind of
like smaller projects, obviously has a lot of benefits both sides, I
mean, it's a really nice way for candidates to get to know companies
and companies to get to know candidates and also kind of build out
their network through working with lots and lots different developers
and people who can contribute. So definitely see, huge positive to
that. And obviously, there's kind of, I'd say, less commitment from
both sides, as a lot of developers and web three are very keen on
working on multiple projects, they want to kind of like, have their
fingers and lots of pies, and work on and contribute to lots of
different things. And there's so much exciting work to be done. That
it it really does bring some benefit. Obviously, there's there's also
a kind of huge benefit to the kind of traditional model of placing
people into kind of like full time contracts with brands, I mean, you
get a lot of benefit to having people full time. I mean, they will,
you know, long term be behind a project. They're invested in the
progress of that project, maybe through kind of like equity, or
options or tokens, or whatever it might be. And, yeah, and there's
something to be said for kind of being a full time member of that
journey as a company builds and develops. So I've seen I have seen
people doing kind of the newer, newer way of working, but I think it
seems like the more kind of like old fashioned way seems to still be
very popular, and I can't really see it kind of diminishing.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">That's
fair point. Drilling on that a little bit more given how decentralise
the hiring space. And also I mean, there's the theme of birth rates,
decentralisation and the hiring the the job requirements, and also
how the team are being built. A lot of them are using a very
decentralised approach, for example, a doubt may come to a
recruitment agency to hire for a staff per se. And some of these, for
example, like you mentioned, working on specific tasks that are
getting bit to become a core contributor might work for that model.

kind of dowels become more, what's the word kind of can't think what
that word is. As they kind of work better and become better at kind
of paying contributors. And you know, there's more tools for them, I
can see it happening more often. And, you know, when it becomes more
reliable for developers to be, you know, achieving, you know,
different bounties and having a kind of like steady income. I can see
that happening, I think, potentially, it it's not, it's not really
got there yet, but I can see it, definitely going in that direction.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Got
you. Appreciate that. Thank you, Laura. For the next set of
questions, I want to zoom out a little bit more and then linking to
kind of the roadmap for ENCODE to wrap it up. It would be kind of the
market positioning and also the roadmap going forward. For market
positioning. I have two questions. One is understanding and code. You
guys are doing blockchain education platform to bring people our repo
into the crypto space and it's chain agnostic and kind of layering
between specific protocol specific layer and going across the wider
breadth. And by going in depth and a little bit more into the web
space, you actually, it's a lot a lot more specific than the
mainstream coding boot camp like lambda lambda schools with this kind
of mid section, vertical positioning, what do you think the
disadvantages and advantages would create for ankle cup being in this
position?</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">right
back after this one, and for the future, we actually thinking about
just doing more of what we're doing right now, mostly because we
think that we are not there yet in terms of we really happy with the,
with the obviously the quality of the programmes that we're doing.
But we think that there's there a lot of people that are still, they
can still benefit from more programmes, meaning that, as I said, we
are now expanding the range of boot camps that we're doing. So we're
trying to cover different different topics on different levels.
Because, as I said, we've seen that even though the market out there
is is quite, is quite different than several months ago, there's
still a lot of, and by that, I mean that while we were in a bull
market, it was all a bit of people and interest of people thinking
like, oh, wait, please now the next thing and everybody was trying to
find a way to kind of become a part of the industry. Well, now that
we're in a, in a bear market, a lot of one would think that some of
that interest would, would die down, and there will be a lot less
interest to programmes such as the ones that we're organising, which
is like basically giving you an opportunity to learn, but we actually
seeing, we're not really seeing that much of a decrease in assets. So
there's a lot of interest, a lot of people still eager to learn. And
that's why our goal for for like the near future, what we're trying
to achieve will be to just scale up and kinda like provide as many
programmes as we can. And to kind of satisfy this quench for
knowledge that we were seeing, in terms of all the negatives, I think
gold is well positioned that regardless of what the market is, we're
here to we're an educational community. And there's always going to
be a need for for for for programmes such as the one that we
organising. So we're quite positive on on the future and what it
brings. And for negatives, I think, obviously, scaling is going to be
a tough task. We, contrary to what a lot of people might think we're
actually a small team with less than 20 people. And all of these
programmes take a toll obviously on everybody. So scaling in a way
that is feasible is going to be a probably the biggest test that we
have.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yep,
yeah. Yeah, I totally lie along with you on this one. If we dive into
this a little bit deeper for my question to its, let's say, we are
looking specifically into Cairo, and even for starting that, there
are still a number of different learning resources. For example,
there is a small scale Cairo tutorial by Henry and also for
hackathons. And you would have started at how CC doing is starting
where themselves hosting their own hackathon and boot camps, or
tutorial sessions. How do you find and CO being competitive in this
range and still being able to survive and compete with the more chain
native or, or layer native educator across a different spectrum?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Um,
I wouldn't say that we're trying to directly compete, because I think
all kinds of education are kind of like complimentary. So I think, I
mean, we're here to for the greater good, really, which is provide
everybody with a different way to learn. So obviously, people learn
in different ways. People assimilate knowledge in different ways. So
we're just happy to provide a platform for people to kind of learn as
much as they can, which would provide them with, as I said, with
opportunity to just achieve their own goals. And for us, I think we
are internally iterating after each and every of the programmes that
we do. As I said, we did a online hackathon. We started at the
beginning of the year, we did an in person one and now we're doing
boot camps as well. Our goal was to obviously provide more programmes
as long as we there is interest for this. And we think that this
interest is only going to be increasing and The future. So our goal
is to basically a quick follow up closely with everybody that is,
that is part of these programmes, and get to know what they like and
know what they didn't like and try to iterate for the better.</font></p>

Great answer. Yeah, ultimately, I think education, it's a public
good, and also an investment of future. And I think what you're doing
what ENCODE is doing in this space is actually adding a lot of equity
in into the future of the web three ecosystem. So as a last point,
for wrapping up the AMA, just want to pass the floor to you to see if
you have any last remark or any products or updates for encode that
you want to share with the committee. Before I I close out the AMA.</font></p>

yeah, there is actually one new thing that we're doing. And it's kind
of like, we're trying to provide something for our community, which
is, we recently announced our own nfts, which is, as of right now,
they're just a staple of, of you being part of our programmes and
successfully going through it. So it's a sort of a memento for for
your achievement of successfully being accepted and gone through,
doesn't help to any of the ones or any of the programmes that we
actually organise. So that that counts for all the educational
series, the hackathons, the accelerators, the boot camps, as well.
And these are all retroactive. So people that have been part
throughout programmes can go and claim them. There is nothing
specific data them as of right now. Not sure about the future. But
it's, it's a nice thing to have. And our community has been asking
for this for for some time now. Because we've seen other others do it
as well. So I think it's a it's a great thing to have. And as I said,
we'll see how popular it ends up being and trying to provide
something more longer in the future.</font></p>

yep, this is really cool. I'm sure it's gonna be very popular. And
basically, it's a badge of honour as for all the battles, exactly.
Veteran that went through the programme and, and have gone through
the ARB and pass on onto the other side. So it's also basically
joining the club and having these types of NF T's basically just kind
of ingrained the grenke. Within the club. Exactly. Sure. Very
fascinating. Okay, for a last bit of housekeeping for our from our
side, it's for the CENTUM friends AMA, we usually would give out a
poll app for our listener. And because this AMA, it's the finale of
the series three, we are planning to do something different. So
listen carefully. So for all participant who joined our AMA, and
still on this ama at the moment, you can take a snapshot of your
profile, and your screenshot in this AMA, and then send a screenshot
to our community mods, and also aren't meant and you will be able to
redeem a whitelist for our test net. So this is something different.
And we want to we listen to the feedback from our community. And we
understand getting COAB sometimes it's really good. But sometimes
you're waiting for what's good for it. So we actually want to mix it
up a little bit. So for this time, it's a special bonus for the
listener here. And that will be all for me and from my side. Thank
you very much, Laura. Thank you very much, guys. And for joining this
AMA. It has been very wonderful and very informative for us to learn
about all the cool things and other informative programmes and
helpful things that you're doing for the ecosystem. Really appreciate
your time. Thank you very much.</font></p>
