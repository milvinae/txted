So I'll kick start everyone. So hello, this is Jane here from z k

our two guests. Gravity owl, who's the CEO of only dust as well as
Stan, who is the tech lead. And, you know, we are, we're very excited
to have you guys here today to tell us a little bit more about some
of the educational initiatives that you guys have done and help
onboard devs into the community. So without further ado, I will pass
it on to gravity and Stan to introduce themselves.</font></p>

so I know I am I'm Greg, my real name is Greg, I'm the CEO of a funny
desk, and I think a young an entrepreneur, you know, I have I have to
die, you know, in high school, but I have launched my company, and I
have sold my previous one, my previous one in December, it was rough
on jancy. And after that I, I tried to launch some figure interested
in web three. I am I fell in love with stack net. So so it was the
beginning of story. And we have launched on the desk with Stan. And
now project is live. So we have done a lot of stuff on the
educational, educational side. And afterwards we have loads of
product and I'm I am organising a stocking etc to and just a little
alpha, we will announce the next stock that is tomorrow, it will be
in this band. So yes, so stay tuned. So yes, it's my background very,
very quickly.</font></p>

I'm Stan, so I'm, I'm a developer, and I've worked for quite a while
in the web to industry. And I've come I've come to the web three,
wealth through Aetherium development. And as, as Greg Welch said, we
really fell in love with the stark medical system. And that's why we
decided to start to build our solution and unstarred. Net and about
Stark nets. So yeah, I'm in charge of well, making the the platform
project happen and, and help help developers to you know, get some
contribution to the platform and be able to work on on stagnant
projects. I think that's it, Jade.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah.
Sorry. I was muted. So So Greg, actually want to drill into your
story a little bit more, because I saw that on your profile, it says
that you sold your web two company to start to go into web three. And
And I'm curious, did you just kind of have a moment of epiphany,
where you realise, okay, wow, this is something I got to do, or was
it a gradual ramp up where you got involved with the stock net
ecosystem, and then eventually, you know, it scaled up to the point
where you felt that you know, it's the right time to move.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">And
I think it's quite funny because for this company, I've raised the
free million Under allows, I think one year ago, it was for what two
company and six months after. So I have started my, I think I have
raised a run for my new company, but I, my previous company wasn't
sold. So I have been able to choose to do activities during three or
four months. And so it was really rewarding though, because after six
months, we have so we have raised money one year ago. And it was
like, Okay, I don't want to do what to stuff anymore. So I have a, I
have talked with all my VC. And I've said, Okay, we are raised for
what two company? But I don't want to do this anymore. Can we go with
free please? My investor we're like, okay, okay, Greg, I think you
can do that. Let's try. So no, we are very happy. So yes, it was very
gradual. I think my VC, so it went to Vc. It turned me into crypto.
So I think it was two years ago, I've invested a lot of my of my
saving at the time. If so it was a good bet. So I'm very happy but
and after that, I just, I was walking on web two and just I have
discovered I have discovered I think web three river has very
gradually and SDN stack net, I think it was three months after the
great the creation of only desk we were searching for, for tech,
technology or layout, they have to build our platform. And some
someone told me about stack nets and we were like, Okay, we will met
this guy, but we don't to do we don't want to work with them. Because
it's not EVM compatible. So we have met our V but you're one of the
developers of DEV advocates. And we're like okay, we will say no but
we want to be be very polite because it was an introduction and we
don't want to be rude. And at the end of the quarter like okay, maybe
it's interesting, very interesting. And one month after we have
decided to fully commit on stack net so yes, it was very unexpected
in stack net was not our first choice but so yes it's quite funny
because I think and it was a bad day for Ray we we normally we should
have consensus day because he has his baby and it was very
complicated for him and we were like no we we can we can go in it's
not the problem so yes it was I think it was a very low probability
to get unstuck net but it appears so it's good</font></p>

think it was it was in in March I think so in March and we decided to
go and stack net in upgrade and we have decided to organise something
at Def Connect for vn upgrade. I think it was just three weeks before
dev connect Amsterdam, we have decided to organise a workshop. And we
have met for the first time we have made our way on Louie and Sanibel
and UI from Stack net but it was a first meeting to just three weeks
after all decision to go on stack net threads it was very very fast
on I think it's it was incredible because I think in in a committee
normally three weeks after a decision you will you are not involved
in the community. But where we are very aware very welcomed us very,
very kindly. So it was just amazing.</font></p>

up and running in March or April and climate conference for July and

introduce only dusk because I actually haven't given a description of

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Okay.
So in fact, when we are objective is to help the protocol so
livestock nets to this Reduce grants to open source projects. Because
found now it's very, very difficult if you are stuck net and you want
to incentive very good developers to work and to run a grant
programme, you know, it's very complicated. And you have a lot of
mercenaries of fruitful for examples of NASCO and developer, just try
to rock pool stagnates Stockwell, so we didn't manage to do that. But
there is a very, very difficult, and we want to unveil oversight we
have, you have a lot of developer, we want to add the ecosystem, but
they don't know how to grant. And they work alone on our site. So we
want to, we have created a marketplace to connect, or the builder or
the developer, and the lead contributor will create an open source
project. And they can recruit some, some contributors, some of our
developer, and together, they, we they can earn grant of con
Stockwell. So in fact, we want to, to create this service system of
have to say that, yes, we want to create this, this marketplace, and
it's happening right now. And it's very, very efficient. Because you
know, when the developer work together, they are not alone. They can
have some ground, they know how much money that will earn, even if
they work. So it's very May, there is a better, better retention, in
better walk. So it's a I think it's it's a vision, it's our mission
is to help the protocol to to create an another open source world,
because normally, if you walk up and source you're not paid. But if
we've read free, you can be paid. So I think just totally amazing. So
we want to develop and create. But Justin,</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">yeah.
And the idea that we have on well about how we can achieve that. And
what we did, we stuck at what we plan on doing with other ecosystem
is? Well, when we first came to start, it was well, it was still the
beginning. But it was really the early days of, of the public stone
ecosystem. And well, we had learned about Cairo and how to write our
first smart contracts to develop the platform itself. And we decided,
at first focus on what you mentioned, during the beginning of the
call about the educational material, meaning with the stockings
project, to well to teach developers how to contribute to start at
projects. And so with this flow of, of qualified developers, we would
have our first users to the to the marketplace. And so that's how we
want to approach do small ecosystem is to Well, first to become good
enough ourselves to be able to teach other people how to work with
the, with the technologies in place, and then teach people and help
them contribute to real life projects in the ecosystem. Because it
will well help them get better at the technologies by contributing to
actual projects. And on the other side, it's a great well, it's a
great resource for us to be able to have people working on the
project. And when we come and talk with projects we we know we have
in mind, people we have talked to who will be able to work on the on
the project tasks.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Thanks,
Dan. And actually, I have a couple follow up questions to that.
Right. I think first is just, I understand that you guys have an
education programme, and then hopefully people who graduate from it
will be able to contribute. But can you just walk me through like, I
guess from the beginning, if I'm a solidity developer, and I'm
interested in learning Cairo, what does the lifecycle or what is the
journey of onboarding ons only does might look like?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif"><b>Stan
 24:11</b></font><font face="Arial, serif">  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Well,
it depends on on which way you hear about on the desk, or stock net.
But what we we did and what we still do today is to well to have some
quick calls with those developers. So you just schedule a quick call
in our calendar, for example, that we share at events or when we meet
people. And we try to see what would be the best fit for you in terms
of where you can learn about Cairo and stagnates. Most of the time,
it would be like starting to work on the startings exercises. And
once you're confident enough, you can start to have some small
contributions on on open source projects. Oftentimes, we also have
contributions Whether or not in Cairo, so if you are solidity
developers, there are high chance that high chances that you know,
maybe also a bit of JavaScript or Python, or rust or whatever that
you can use to, to participate into projects from the stock ethical
system, but which are not like pure care projects, you always have
the need for other skills. And this is a good way to get into the
ecosystem, you will start with what you already do with JavaScript,
for example, and then you will see what the project is and get on
boarded, like gradually on the on the more well, specific tasks in
Cairo, for example.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Wow,
that's amazing. So you guys actually do like a one on one
consultation with the developers who are interested to learn to, to
kind of give them a little bit more advice or like a little bit more
tailoring as to how they should approach their learnings.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yes,
some time I have 20 or 40 calls a week with developers, and they have
to manage with my very good English. But happy with that. And as I
went to find the good way to learn Cairo, and and fix, we are always
begin with what is your objective? What is your favourite tech? What
do we want to learn? And after about, I can say, okay, you can
contribute on this project, or, for example, some people just want to
create some ideas for the vehicle system. And I tell them, for
example, to create a new open source project, I give him a budget and
say, Okay, I can help you to find some contributor with your project.
And you can begin, some people just want to learn tarot, for example,
and we have a big game. It's called stack conquest. And we want to
organise a big tournament for developer, I started noticing this burn
for his opponents. Okay, if you are a beginner, you can do that. Of
that. Of that. And you can take this contribution. So yes, we, we
want to help developer in a one to one way with just not automatic it
just so we will them so. And if the robot Young is, is listening is
listening with tweeter space, you could just contact me on Twitter
and we say set up a call and I can help you. It's my pleasure.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">That's
great. Thanks a lot, Greg. So actually, I think you've kind of
answered my next question. But I want to dig a little bit deeper to
see if you guys had any other thoughts on this, which is, there are
quite a few educational programmes out there. And I've seen them like
Henry's OG Cairo tutorials. And code does a lot of hackathons. And
then there's obviously the stock nut house CC that took place this
summer. How do you guys kind of think of your positioning versus some
of these other educational programmes?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif"><b>Stan
 27:56</b></font><font face="Arial, serif">  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Well,
for this, I think, Well, we, we take this as opportunities for us not
to work on this educational material and focus on the platform
itself. So it's a very good, it's a very good thing for us. In, you
know, in in a very optimistic way, we want these projects to happen
and this kind of material to put up and, and to help us have very
qualified developers on the platform. So I mean, stop is is not the
end goal for us. It's only a matter of having a flow of developers
and and interested developers into the K word ecosystem. But the goal
is to have people on the platform so so I would say that the more
initiatives they are like this, the better it is, because it will
bring more people. Maybe sometimes if you look at the content from
Henry, for example, it's more about like, you know, having your hands
on actual contract deployed on the test net, stockings on the other
side is very like theoretical in terms of how the camera works. And,
you know, if we, if we multiply all those sources of overrunning, it
will be better for the developers themselves. So in the end, it's a
good it's a good thing for us and for the ecosystem.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
absolutely. And I've, I've just seen more and more resources pop up.
And I I've often heard that one of the key complaints of developers
has been the lack of resources with Cairo. So I'm sure kind of as the
ecosystem evolves, and more of these become available. It's just more
touch points for people to learn. Great, so I'd actually like to move
on to the next section, which is how I could become a contributor on
or with only dust. Could you just discuss with me a little bit more
about Okay, so if I'm someone who graduated out of the ER, I went
through Stark winds, right? How often do you actually see people take
off on contributions, or do you often find them to be existing
developers within the ecosystem looking to take on contributions?</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">I
think there are many situation different different cases, we see a
lot of developers being dragged to the platform, from the the
interest they have in the project themselves. So for example, we took
to, to, to the, the, what we call the lead contributors. So it is the
while the core team have given projects, for example, for the rest of
the dev net, from South labs, and people will get to the platform
because they are interested in the project itself. And they will want
to contribute. And they will get in touch with the people working on
the project. And they will be directed to the to the platform. And so
that's one way of coming to the platform. The other one is yeah, as
you mentioned, to well, graduates, from stockings and get in touch
with the latest team. And so we, we we invite them to go to the to
the platform to try to put in practice what they've learned on the
stockings. And, and I think there are more and more people just
visiting the platform, not having worked on stockings, but being
confident enough to want to try the first small contribution on the
platform and see how it goes. And in the end, like getting confident
and getting more and more contributions and getting involved in in,
in working in these projects.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
absolutely. Thank you for that. And, and in terms of some of the
interesting projects that have actually created contributions,
contribution requests I've seen, obviously, Stark net, Jas. That's a
big one. I've seen astrally. And I've even seen your very own
sparklings actually have contributions? Could you give us a little
bit more examples or tell us what these tasks actually are?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
I think they are. Quite so range about what the tasks are. But
usually, when the project starts to put some contribution on the
platform, they want also to give it a try. And they will not start
with, you know, very core contributions, very core features that they
want to develop. So they will start with maybe some bug fixing, or
library or date or lack of documentation. And once they've will get
confident enough with the platform and the developers working on the
platform, they will bring more and more interesting contributions.
And that's how, for example, as Charlie worked, and that's what we
see, we stuck to Jas and you Well, let's it's normal, you need to
have some first feedbacks from the first contributions to, to well,
to get confident with the quality of the work brought by the Platform
Developers. For us, well, as you said, we use our platform to develop
the platform itself. So that's very convenient for us. Because when
we have some features that pop up or when we have an urgent needs,
that was not planned, and we don't want to disturb the flow of the
current integration we make on the features, well, we're just put
this contribution on the platform, and we're sure that there will be
someone interested in in working with on this. And that, that's
really cool. The, the example I have is, we were missing the gravels
for that connection. So I'm very sorry, there are some people from
Bibles in this call, but we only were compatible with with the urgent
exploits. And we did not have time to develop this connection,
because it was not like a core feature for us. And we, we wanted to
standardise the platform and to work on the back end, etc. And so we
opened a contribution on this and, and a developer I got a call with
living in in Brazil wanted to get into the ecosystem and to learn how
to code in Cairo. And he knew a bit of js and so he just took the
opportunity to integrate this for its DDB four and then on another
project and it was while it was really a win win situation because
for us it was like life saving to have this compatibility which was
really mandatory for our users. And and for him it was also a really
good opportunity to well to get in touch with the team and to get on
board and on the project.</font></p>

just contact him and say, Okay, I've seen your work. It's very, very
cool. So now you have a full job, full, full job at this company. So

so that leads me to my next question, which is around selection
criteria and compensation. So let's just say I, there are 10
developers who are very interested in participating in one
contribution that has been listed. How do you guys actually or is it
you guys? Or is it the project that actually selects? And how do how
do you guys are benchmark like correct level of compensation that
developers will get paid? So two parts to my question, maybe we can
start with the first one.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">the
question for me? Thank you, Stan. Yeah. For now, we select the
contributor. In fact, we are looking, we just opened our GitHub CV,
our past contribution, the contribution on GitHub, the contribution
on the platform, and the activity, no discount. So I think we have
pre created if for now. And it works very well. Because if you see
someone who is always asking some question, or I think helping other
people in the discard, and is active on the platform, for example,
you have already done Freo, three or four contribution, and we have a
good GitHub, it's the go to it's the way to select people. And but
next week is a project we'll select via Vonage as because it's easier
for us on the platform side. But next week, there wouldn't be a new
release, and the open source project will still act as the
application themselves. So we'll see. But I think we it's a free free
important. Retire pass. And I think it would be the same for the
project. But yes, it is the way we do so. Yes, if you are if you are
already contributing on open source project on the platform or not,
it's a strong signal for us. And for the globalisation, I think our
objective is not to, it's important for us if you can earn more
money, and the platform Van Van being freelance is the programme, you
know, because we don't want to have some mercenaries. So I think we
try to, to achieve a balanced, you can earn the same amount of money
on the platform if you are freelance or if you are an open source
contributor. For us. It's fair. And so yes, we help project to design
the compensation. And it's very, very out. And in fact, we are we are
creating some some meet some meeting all week, we've all project and
we help them to to create a fast fair compensation system to follow
it's very manual. And it's a lot of it's a lot of manual work. But we
think that it's the future, it will be easier. But for now, it's very
manual as a compensation system to be because we want to be fair.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">And
under under selection parties, just to add something, we see a lot of
cases where people don't have that much of a big GitHub, either that
just created it because there are developers in some former
companies, and they do not work on open source projects. So they
don't have well field. GitHub. So in this case, is we don't want to,
we don't want to, you know, put a strong barrier. We don't want to
stop people from trying to contribute. So we will just give it a try,
you know, like trying to assign them to some small contribution so
that they can make a proof of they know well how to contribute and
and that's how we just try and learn from from assigning to small
contributions. And we hope that, you know, is a great number of
trials, you you'll find some qualified people willing to work on the
project, even if they don't have a very, very talkative GitHub
profile. Yeah, actually,</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">now
I have a follow up question to that because I've been thinking about
it, right. Let's just say you have a very qualified developer who's
very interested in contributing to a certain listing. On the other
hand, you might have someone who's a little bit more inexperienced,
but very enthusiastic, very excited to get involved with the
ecosystem and can and probably do the job. How I just how would you
think about, like weighing who is more qualified or who you
necessarily? I know, there's no hard and fast rule. But how do you
think about, you know, placing the two?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Well,
I think, as Greg said, today, this is our choice to make the decision
between these two profiles. But tomorrow, it will be the projects
ones. So if I were a project, I would say that in this situation, I
would rather create a new contribution to try the two profiles rather
than choosing between the two, because both look alike pricing. And
so it's way easier to create a new contribution, because you always
have needs on a project. It's way easier than choosing between two
developers and well, having to make these choices it's well, you
would, maybe it was a very great profile, compared to just taking
maybe 10 minutes to think about a contribution.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Boss,
this partnership is very, very important. Because with this, because
it was token allocation, you know, and we want to use this token
allocation for all developer. So we will use this further was our
developer community or contributor, so far, is it just a way to
reward them in the future? I think? And yes, for us, it's very
important. And it was a discussion with Ray and we were like, Okay,
we want to, to add our contributor on to the world, when can we do
that, and he was like, Okay, guys, we can we can try, we can, you
can, we can have a strategic partnership together. And you can use
the funders the way you want. So for us it was it is the main
objective, it's to it to very well to the reptile community. If you
are not a developer and you are not working on the platform, it will
be impossible to have some out of out of a welder, I don't know.
Sorry for you guys. But if you're a developer, and you're involved,
when you do create open source projects, you contribute on the
platform, I think it will be very, very cool for you in the next
month should do this, because there is a compensation, you know, in
US dollar, some some IDN computation in the future, and we are
working on it. And we want to be very candid with our contributors.
So it's it's our main objective. And on the on the strategic
partnership, you know it because we want to work with dark net on the
on the long way, it's very important for us to create a stable
partnership, and we will open new ecosystem in the future, we will
not be exclusive and exclusive with stock stock, well, we will work
with our ecosystem. But I think we want to create tankless
fluorescent chips and just open one ecosystem. And after we Yes, we
want to establish a strong partnership. And after five or six months,
open a new Russian we want the vacuum system. But we want to be very,
very careful with this. Because if you have too many ecosystem or
you're difficult to use, or you're not bringing some value to the
ecosystem, it just not working. So just starting to get stuck. Well

mentioned, a lot of the grants were that compensate. Developers are
coming from Stark where so as as a project or as other project
developers that are listening in on this Twitter spaces, maybe you
can share a little bit more on I guess why? Or how they could

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Sure,
well, the ID is it's a bit like for the developers today we get
calls, making spending some time with the project to understand what
is the vision of the project, and what would be the first
contribution, they would want to list on the on the platform. The
main ideas that when we talk with the project, they were very
enthusiastic about the idea of listing some issues from their GitHub
on on the platform, because we basically come to them and tell them
Well, if you think about a part of your roadmap that you can
externalise to people outside of your organisation or, or association
or Well, basically the project itself, we can well find people
qualified to work on this and more interesting for the project, we
will pay them with the grants. So it's, well it's a big benefit for
the project, because they know that they will have some external
power of development on the project, and they won't have to organise,
you know, this, this teaching phase or, or wondering about how we can
pay them or how much or whatever, you just have to focus on the on
the contribution is once you list on the platform, and for this
contributions. What would be the? Well, I think your question was
also how can I choose between what I list on the on the on the
platform, compared to what I have internally on core with my core
team of developers, as I said before, which way to, to, to tell the
project to give it a try with the platform in which the developers
and and use some first small issues small enough to get them in touch
with developers and maybe meet some very good developers that they
will want to work with on a more regular basis afterwards. And, and
that's also, as you mentioned, before, a kind of recruitment
strategy. It's a bit like getting to know how to work together,
almost for free, because for the project, it's only a matter of
spending some time to write the issues and review the work on the
other developers. And for the developer themselves. It's getting paid
for the time you spend on open source projects. So it's really
attractive to and once you have a good relationship between the
people from the project and the developers themselves, you can start
to think about like more advanced issues that you will want to list
on the platform and make those developers working on these subjects.</font></p>
