I'm sure that our community members are excited too. So back to the
AMA. There are two parts that we're going to do. And the first part,
I'm going to ask our guest speakers some questions that I had
prepared beforehand, followed by the second part, which is a q&amp;a
session, where our community members are open to ask us anything. You
guys can comment the questions down below right now, on the comment
section on Twitter space, or maybe just later, just go straight ahead
and request to speak. And after this AMA, we will choose five winners
of our giveaway. And those winners will split $200 award. Bert and

wonderful. Okay, so to kick things off, can you guys tell us a little
bit about yourself, your maybe your background and how you started
with Bravo's and also can you do a little introduction about the team
behind Bravo's?</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Sure.
So my background is computer science engineering. I was what you can
call for my entire professional career almost for my entire
professional career and web to entrepreneur and came into crypto
relatively late like a year and a half ago. And but was fortunate
enough to have the time to you know really dive in and understand
that technology in depth understand the various L one solutions that
exist out there and decided that Aetherium has the best chance to to
be the most dominant chain going forward. But as Aetherium has a
scalability problem. It needs a scaling solution. And then study the
all the possible scaling solution, whether it's side chains,
optimistic roll ups, z k roll ups, and in that study, came across
stock net was amazed by stocking technology. And I decided to start
building on staff it together with with my team with my with my co
founders. Which we as an anecdote, I can say that we know each other
I think for almost 14 years now. We've worked together in in previous
companies in previous ventures. So at least the founding team of
Bravo's has a very long history. And now we have belt also that came
into the team and we were happy to have him with us. And both maybe
before I continue a Bessa I sit down to you to introduce yourself.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

Blancheton  10:03  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Thank
you for the introduction. So I have a totally different background
because I come from the business side, basically, mainly marketing
marketing in web two, I work on a lot of SAS project before, so lots
of digital marketing. But it was about like one and a half years ago,
I started to be really interesting with the community aspect of
marketing. So all this community led approach and obviously, the fact
that it was interesting with this topic, bring me to the concept of
web three, where I started to discover you know, different projects.
So I was already a crypto enthusiast, but I never made you know, the
link between my job and the crypto, but understanding that old most
of projects in crypto and web three need to be drilled with a
community approach. I dive deeper and I work on my first project get
some experience and few months ago I met I met Moti we discuss
Bravo's projects, this technology but of course division, which is
really important for me when we when we talk when we have to build a
community and we agree on the vision the way we should we should
drive the growth for Braavos through the community. So I joined the
project about less than two months ago now. And and the project is of
course to to employ or community led approach for Bravo's</font></p>

Wonderful, wonderful that was an amazing introduction and a some
interesting backstory there and well. We are glad to get to see that
what you guys and your awesome team have been working on Bravo's
wallet. It's a great work. Thank you. So so now let's dive deeper.
Let's talk about Bravo's and I believe most of the people that are
joining us joining us right now had already used Bravo's wallet or at
least heard about Bravo's before. So Bachchan, can you just briefly
introduce Bravo's and some key features of Bravo's</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">so
I will let Moti doing that because he's definitively the right guy
for it.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Of

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Monty
Lavie  12:30  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
no problem. So, you know, maybe I will take it a step back and
describe what, what brought us to develop Bravo's because you know
there are like gazillion wallets out there. So why do we need yet
another wallet? And I think that the answer to that is that the
wallet experience in crypto is still not as good as we want it to be.
And I think one of the you know, one of the amazing evidence for that
is that even people who are in crypto today, the let's call them the
early adopters, the let's say 200 300 millions that already uses
crypto, the vast majority of them like 80 90% are using crypto in
centralised solutions, centralised solutions like by Nance like
Coinbase like Kraken like sells us or at least used to use Celsius.
And you know, you cannot blame users for using centralised solutions,
because they give a much better experience than decentralised
solutions. And then the self custodial wallets that that we all know
they give it a an experience that is much closer to a web to
experience that, that people are used to with when using the everyday
apps. And in self custodial wallets self custodial solutions are
complex, they have all these you know, scary words like private keys
and seek phrases. And the cost of error is is significantly high. And
the the chance that ever will happen is also high because you you
deal with all sorts of numbers, long strings of numbers and
characters that normal users should not deal with. And, and you know,
for us that was part of the core thing that brought us to to develop
browsers because we saw it on Stark net. With smart contract based
wallets and with very low gas fees. And with the advancing zero
knowledge proofs, we can take the user experience To lift it up and
bring it to the level that users expect, the level that they get
today from web to solution. And by debt will help move users from web
to end centralised crypto, which is not really crypto into the
decentralised world and self custodial solutions. So that's, that's
like our reason that play if you like, the reason of existence, of
why brothers now in brothers, in the past few months, we, we, we
start tying in, in doing what we what I call the bread and butter, so
everything that even the most basic wallet need. And we did, I think,
a bit more than that. So we have mobile versions that you can find in
the Android store and the iOS store. And we have browser versions
that you can find in all the popular browsers, Chrome, brave Firefox
edge, and so forth. And the wallet features itself then, of course,
it has all the basics of holding your tokens and transferring and
showing your, your balance and so forth. But it also has a built in
capability to show your NF T's whether it's images, audio video,
already inside a wallet, it has an internal exchange to swap tokens.
So if you want to swap your eat to other tokens or bat, you can do
that right within the wallet, you don't need to go out to another
solution. Of course, there is a link to onramp to easily on ramp
either from other exchanges, or from a elwen or from other networks,
or from credit card, or Apple pay directly to your boss wallet on on
stock. So all of this and more is already done. It's already behind
us. And now we are looking forward and are implementing these days,
the cool features of smart contract based wallets and account
abstractions that we can dive into if you like.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">StarkNet

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome,
awesome. I love it. I think, buddy, he has covered pretty much all
the features of Bravo's and so you you just mentioned that Braavos is
a smart contract based wallet. Can you tell us some differences
between a smart contract wallet with other kinds of wallets out
there?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Monty
Lavie  17:46  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yes.
So that relates to what I previously say the fact that there are
already good singing wallets and who needs another wallet. And the
thing is that the fact that smart contract based wallet can really
help us in improving the user experience. And maybe let's get a few
examples to demonstrate what we mean by saying creating a much better
user experience. So we will start with the like with the simple
things and then maybe move on to more advanced things. So one of the
things maybe first to explain what is a smart contract based Wallet.
So unlike the meta mask of the world, which is only a client side,
what everything happens on the client side, and you signed
transactions on the client side and send them to the blockchain. A
smart contract based wallet has a manifestation there is like a part
of your wallet exist as a smart contract on chain. So you have the
client side, which is the application or the browser extension. And
you have the smart contract side which actually resides on the
blockchain. And each and every of your transactions, the transactions
that you sign on the wallet on the client side, they go through your
smart contract that represent your account on the blockchain. And
from that, it goes through the different protocols and the different
decentralised apps that you want to communicate. Now the fact that we
have this smart contract on chain that represents your account gives
us an enormous power and open a wide space of things that we can do
in order to improve the UX and let me give a few examples. So one is
a multi operation multicol So if you are familiar with traditional
wallets on Aetherium. Let's say when you interact with certain
protocol and a certain token, you first need to approve that okay,
and then you can and only then you can transfer token, or do some
interaction with a token. And usually this approved that the the
protocol that adapt that you interact with request is an unlimited
amount, meaning you give this this protocol this DAP, you give
unlimited access to your fund. And you you're, you hope that there
won't be any bug and that the the protocol we withdraw from your your
account only the the amount needed for the operation. But, but in
fact you give it an unlimited like an open check and unlimited
capability to redraw all the funds in your account. And that's of
course a very bad uniques. And there were a few hacks in the past
that utilise that. And with smart contract based wallet, we don't
need to do that because we can couple this approve and the actual
execution, the extra transaction with the wallet, all in the same a
transaction that is being verified on the smart contract which is
which is on chain. So if I want to do a swap, I don't need to approve
an unlimited amount and then go to the swap, I can wait one
transaction approve only the exact amount that I want to swap and the
swap transaction itself. So that's one example of one very simple
example why smart contract based wallets are better. But there are of
course, much more, maybe it will give a couple of more, just to make
it a bit a bit clearer. So it the second example, which I really like
is what we call account segmentation. Meaning I can define</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">various
types of accounts. Let's say I wanted to find a checking account and
I wanted to find a savings accounts. And in my checking accounts, I
want to be able to send transactions quickly with let's say, with no
time delay, but with the daily withdrawal limit. Like think of that
like your your your ATM card. So you cannot empty your entire bank
account with with the ATA ATM card, there is some some sorts of
limit. And that's a good thing. Because if my my ATM card gets lost,
then I know that maybe the thief can steal from you, but they cannot
empty my entire account. And so that's one thing. But on the other
thing, maybe I had a savings account, which I have more money there.
And in that case, it's not important to me, you know, to to be able
to transact very, very quickly and withdraw the money or transfer the
money with a split of a second. But it is important for me very
important for me that it will be secure. So on my savings account, I
can set no withdrawal limits. But I can set a time delay, let's say
that I need to re approve the the transaction again, like 24 or 48
hours after I made it in order to in order for that to to actually go
through and descent on the on the blockchain. And that feature, which
is for me, I think it's very, it's very useful because I want that my
huddling account, my holding crypto will be as secure as possible.
Unlike the the maybe the the small, change the checking accounts that
should be more active. And that leads us to the fact that we have a
smart contract on chain that can verify multiple signatures. So I can
have a built in mechanism of two factor authentication. Like we know
from the web to wall, for example. When I want to login to a certain
service, then it's not enough that I enter my password. I need to
authenticate myself in an additional way. And again, the fact that we
have smart contract based wallet on the blockchain allows us to do
such things.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome,
awesome. Well, I think that was a great answer. I very detailed and
yeah, and I appreciate that. Yeah. So can I can I so I have been
hearing a lot about a count abstraction lately. And you guys are
building problems based on this idea. So could you just just explain
to those of us who, who don't actually understand what a can
abstraction is, you know, just in simple words, and what does it mean
when you apply this kind of technology into problems?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
what I've just been describing in the past few minutes is exactly
account obstruction. So you can think of account obstruction as a
synonym to Who to smart contract based wallet, the fact that I take
your account, which is let's say in meta mask wallet, it's only in
the client side. And I put it on chain. And I create an abstraction
of your account. And as we said earlier, everything all transaction
that comes from the client site go to this account. And this account
can in this contract the smart contract, which represent my account
can run an arbitrary logic. And this is the the actual what is called
account obstruction and EIP for creepy seven. And that was was, was
published a while ago. So when everyone when when you hear people say
account obstruction, what they really mean is a smart, contract based
wallet, that all transaction goes through the network to the smart
contract that represent your account.</font></p>

nice. Yeah, that's a very easy to understand. And I think our
community and was a really appreciate, appreciate your answer. Thank
you, Martin, for keep it simple. Yeah. So the next question for you
guys. Is that what critical problems does Bravo's solve that existing
solutions are not solving? And how do you distinguish problems from
other wallets out there on the market?</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I
can take it for part like user point of view if you want. And on the
technical part. I literally live on companies I say when? Yeah,
sorry. Okay, let's go. When I joined as a project, you know, a big
discussion we got with Marty's like, we want to make this project
Bravo's wallet really accessible for everyone. So it's mean, we
understand that today we face community, which is like crypto fiends
understand defies understand most of the tech, but we still you know,
is a con segmentations everything from education to do and so on. But
the fact is, I really in the discussion, what I really enjoyed about
the project as a project was all the parts of of the roadmap, we
wanted to make the product really simple for new crypto affine. You
know, like the next wave of people, we're gonna we're gonna join us
on the defy journey. And for me, it was the big work I saw done by
the tech team in the last weeks and last month is the UX. It's, we
got a lot of positive feedback on that people really enjoy because
it's simple. Of course, the technologies that Moti just described
with account abstraction, the multi core and so on will help as well,
you know, to make the UX and CX even better. So that was that this
is, I believe, a big advantage from from Bravo's. The second point is
we are the only mobile native app, which makes, again, which
simplify, you know, the whole experience of defy via Bravo's, because
you do all your transaction, strong transaction from your desktop,
but then, you know, you can control and do like simple transaction
from your mobile. So I think it's really really important. This last
point is about all the securities that the fact that we are so is the
fact that we are smart contract based, bring a lot of security
aspect, not only, you know, the technical parts, security, which is
developed, you know, in the in the backend, I mean, for people to
manage, as Multijet explain, you know, how much value or value of
your asset can be transferred in once and so on. I think this is
really important to give confidence for new user. And I think this is
something which makes us be different that I mean, clearly different
from what you have on the on the market.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Maybe
just to I think it's a great summary. And just to add another point
to that. We, as a conscious decision, decided to work solely on stock
next. We believe that l twos are the future of Ethereum and in the L
two realms. We believe that stock that has the most solid technology
and the most promising technology to take to take Aetherium and scale
it to hundreds of 1000s of transactions per second and really bring
the industry to where we think it should be. And that's that's our
sole focus. We are not working on other networks. And we are not
trying to cover the entire flip. to space, the focus is to bring the
best solution possible to start with.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Wonderful
one. So, the next question, can you update Bravo's progress to our

that you guys wish to accomplish in the near future, like for the
rest of 2022, and maybe in 2023.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
I think I touched upon that a bit earlier. But maybe just to
summarise, I think that what we've done up until now is, as I said,
the bread and butter of having a wallet. So we have the wallet on all
platforms, iOS, Android browser extension, we have all the basic
functionality and features of offer wallet, like a transfer and
showing your balance and creating accounts and the whole year nfts.
And as I mentioned, also exchange within the wallet, and we added a
transaction capability. So users will understand the transactions
that they are signing on and wouldn't be like a Meaningless,
meaningless, random numbers and letters. But I consider all that as
the bread and butter and now focuses on taking the advantage of a
smart contract on chain, and really implementing the increased
security with two factor authentication. And the different account
types as I described earlier with with account segmentation, and
allow different signature schemes, and that will, that will help
users manage and secure their funds better. And many, many such
features that not all I can show today that are expected to be
deployed in the in the next few weeks and months.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
cool. Nice. Thank you for sharing those. I think that's what our
community really wants to hear what what are you doing? What's your
plans? And what your ideas for the future? And we're looking forward
to those happening soon? Yes. So the next question, and this is also
the last question from me to you guys. What partnerships between
Bravo's and other projects on stock net? Can we expect in 2022? And
could you give us some examples of how other projects can leverage?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>

Lavie  32:50  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
so I think that we, you know, as I said earlier, is we are solely
focused on stock and if we try to work closely with, with all or at
least most of the protocols in, in, in, in the ecosystem. So, of
course, we have a very solid partnership with Stuxnet itself, in
order to continue and push the network, from alpha to beta, from the
current state to Regenesis. Have a have the stock network, and let's
call it a full production network. So that's, that's, of course one.
There are the market, the NFT marketplaces that we already cooperate
with, and they are already accessible from from the wallet. And there
are game developers that are working on on stack net that still not
in full production, but once they they will be in full production,
they will be integrated into the wallet. So the user will have like a
one click kind of experience. Certainly if it's if it's on mobile,
which currently placed Braavos is the only way to access stuff on
mobile using the Bravo's native application for Android and in iOS.
There are more protocols to come there is ens DNS like domain names
that don't coming to start now that will be integrated into the
wallet and and we already integrated with with defy using using the
Microsoft Exchange and we are planning to do integrate and cooperate
with modify protocols and bring them into the wallet. So the users
will will be able to, to have a one click earn yield a one click swap
with the best rate, and everything will actually be with, with a one
click or one tap distance on the Bravo's wallet.</font></p>

second part of this. Ama answering some questions from the community.
So I can see a lot of questions from in the comment section. Guys,
can can you see the comment section? On Twitter? What looks like Yes.
Yeah, I see. Yeah. Well, looks like the community is quite active

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
cool. Okay, so. Okay, um, so the first question, can you indicate a
feature or features that you like best about Bravo's so that it can
compete with other competitors? And what is the thing that you are
most confident about your product?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Monty
Lavie  36:52  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Hmm,
that's a great question. I think that one thing that, that I at
least, like very much is the transaction, explainer. The fact that
when when I came into crypto and I got lots of like, popups, in the
wallet that asked me to sign transaction, you know, I didn't really
understand what I'm signing on. So I tried to read what it said. But
in most part, it was, it was a bit gibberish. And you know, I have
like a technical background. But you cannot really understand sending
this and that to that. And that address. You don't really know what
happens behind the scene, and we did a transaction, explain how users
really understand what they are saying, you know, so for example,
when it's protocol X asks them to give an unlimited access to their
tokens, they say, Hey, wait a minute, I don't want to give unlimited
access to my tokens. And before our transaction explain now, they
wouldn't know that because it was like hidden in various strings and
numbers without plain English and saying this protocol wants to get
unlimited access to your tokens. And so, so that's one thing that
that I really like. And I think it's really useful. And, of course,
we constantly continue to work on that and improve that. And I think
that in terms of going forward, so the features of a smart contract
based wallet, and that improve both the UX and security, these are
the things that the time was exciting about excited about the ability
to do biometric two factor authentication, without the need of
additional hardware. When you're using when you're using your mobile
device. These are things that that for me, really, you know, really
get me excited. And as I mentioned, we have a few more interesting
things that we will expose. A bit further down the line in the in the
future. So definitely, there is stuff to look forward to.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">StarkNet
Vietnam Community  39:20  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
cool. Thank you. So the next question is, is there a, is there any
security risks in smart contract of the wallet? Body? So I guess the
question is that have you ever audited, Bravo's smart contract with
any external parties?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Monty
Lavie  39:43  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
not yet. The reason is twofold. One is since we, as you as you've
just heard, we are still in the midst of development, and are still
core functionality or what we consider core functionality that we
want to that we want to add to the wallet. In order for that to be
primetime ready and ready for, at least call it version 1.0. of
auditing. So that's one thing. And the second thing is that stock net
is a whole, the network as a whole has not been audited, it's still
in alpha, it's still under development, it seems, needs to do the
Regenesis process, which is which is a huge and very significant and
important process. And it makes much less sense to perform the audit
before starting to go to Regenesis. And before what is called chi or
wind point, oh, Kira is the is a programming language that we use to
write smart contract on Stuxnet. So before chi will move from the
current version to hywind ponto. That is going to change quite quite
a few things, both in terms of syntax, but also under the hood and in
the virtual machine itself, that the trans the blockchain. So it's,
you know, it's much more advisable to perform the audit after the
Regenesis.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">StarkNet
Vietnam Community  41:16  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Nice,
okay, that was a great answer. Yeah.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Monty
Lavie  41:20  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">But
it is important for me to, to emphasise audit or no, no audit. You
know, I constantly joke that we are a team that is relatively new to
crypto. But we are kind of veterans on Stuxnet. Because we've been
working on Stuxnet for over a year now and actually promises the
second protocol that we have launched. So we have quite the
experience on stock. And we have quite the experience with Kira,
probably not less, if not, if not more than many people out there.
And taking into account this and the fact that we rigorously tests,
both the client side of the wallet and the contract side, then we
take security very seriously. Even before audits and even before
Regenesis. Naturally, we understand that we deal with people's funds,
people money, and we take a great deal in order to make sure it is
safe.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Well,
it's it's hard to say the short term is always hard to say and always
hard to predict it you know, has it outside influence like the state
of the entire crypto market and maybe even the state of the stock
development itself? So very hard to predict the short term, but for
the long term as I said earlier, we focused solely on target and we
want to be the main gateway to onboard people on on stock net, so we
are talking next year and hundreds of 1000s of users and after that
in much higher numbers as the network will thrive.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
so so I'm gonna I'm gonna switch to the questions on the comments
section. So what is your view about crypto wallets in the future?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Monty
Lavie  44:51  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Oh,
so I think that's that's another great question. I think that crypto
wallets all crypto wallets in the future will be smart contract based
wallet, because simply they enable a much greater experience and much
better security. I think this is one of the most underestimated kind
of jam in the in the crypto industry and, and going forward moving
like two or three years into the future, we will see that the vast
majority of wallets will will either be smart contract based wallet
or make the transition to be smart, contract based wallet. Okay. And
maybe to maybe to expand a bit on that. And I think that in terms of,
of users, mass adoption of users, we need to bring as many services
as possible into the wallet itself in order to make users life easier
and simpler, and not requiring them to be familiar with the different
depths and the different risks and rewards and make the entire
experience much more simpler, much.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Much
simpler, much, much more streamlined. And I believe this will be
flywheel that can help bring more and more users into into the field.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
cool. So I see another question. Another good question. Then. The
native standard bridge start gate support only automax wallet for
transactions to our to when will the Bravo's wallet be integrated
into the stock a and what other preachers can use a chest for
advantage use for a one hour tube bridging? And could this feature be
integrated in Bravo's UI UX?</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah
really good question. I saw it and feel Morty want to do and well
that.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
so So first of all, Bravo's is supported by Stargate Stargate is one
of the first daps to support browsers from day one. So if you go to
Stargate, with your brothers wallet extension installed, and you can
easily connect to that and quickly and smoothly transfer funds. You
can do that either by going to Stargate directly from your browser or
clicking on the Stargate link within the browser extension. If you
open the extension, you can click deposits and you see the various
way that you can bring funds into the wallet and Stargate is one of
them. Other options is to use obiter obiter is another bridge that
allows to breach funds from various networks, whether it's
centralised network or other l ones that use directly to your
brother's wallet. You can also deposit money from credit card using
banks app. You can also use Apple Pay and deposit money directly. And
I believe that in the next couple of weeks, we will introduce another
yet another mechanism that will allow you to bring funds to to your
Bravo's Wallet. So most definitely Stargate support Bravo's if there
is any issue, then please, please write to us either on our Discord
or on Twitter and we will be happy to assist and supporting in using
Stargate to to onramp funds on to grab us.</font></p>

And with pleasure. Always on pot on the community for us. Huge. It's,
I mean, actually, I thought I joined the project, this project
barbels because because of this aspect during our discussion with
Mati he always you know, bring me a vision and how we can like
leverage the community on the good aspect of it. It's been really
getting the feedback getting the sense I was can drive the Part of
our innovation and so on. So, we are not looking for a huge community
on numbers. We are looking for community and quality. So how do we
translate that first is like working with project like you guys being
close to you getting the feedback from the ecosystem from the project
MCO we can help you to evangelise good tech people coming on our
ecosystem as well.</font></p>

yet. We are we centralised community in our Discord for the moment
everything is online, we haven't done much activity on the suspect.
It will come of course, because it's my it's my duty. So I have a lot
of things to sort out first on top of marketing, creating the right
content for you to know how we will organise our interaction and so
on. So but you will see like lots of activity from outside very soon
on this aspect. So first, if you want to join the community is
definitively our Discord. Of course Twitter to get in touch getting
less news and so on. And little by little we will develop what we
