Yeah, no, of course. Thank you guys for coming on today. This is
gonna be a very fun a very fun Twitter spaces. We don't usually have.
I can't remember the last time we had like a spaces with a Wallet
team. So that should be very interesting, actually, different types
of questions this time around. Looking forward. Awesome. Awesome.
Well, as you guys know, in the audience, very likely. My name is
Hunter. I'm the community manager over here at arbitrage comm. I am
joined today by Alex, as well as Stefan or ally, Meister. If you guys
want, maybe you can give a kind of quick introductions on kind of
what you guys do at Omni. And then I'll kind of just jump into some

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yes,
yes, of course. Again, thank you guys for coming on. So a couple of
questions today, I think it's gonna be really very interesting one.
For those of you who don't know, it actually was just rebranded to
Omni from steak wallet. And I know there's a couple of different ways
we can actually go about starting this but I think I actually want to
ask, I want to start off with first why the rebrand and then maybe
like, kind of tilt into the actual kind of product of the wallet
itself. Yeah, first of all, yeah, exactly. Like while I rebrand to
Tommy.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lionmeister.eth
 4:37  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
it was it was a tough choice to be honest, because we we absolutely
love the stakeholder brand. And not sure how many in the audience
have actually interacted with stakeholder prior to this. But we had
all these little steak, you know, figurines and characters we had,
you know, a cow that kind of looked like salt Bay, which was called
Kobe, and we had, you know, an ape that was kind of Like a take on
Haoran Bay? And yeah, it's kind of like a very fun and endearing
brand. But, you know, so when when, when when Omni events take Well,
it started it was it was really a passion project, right? It was
April of April of last year. And it was really awesome to see post
defi summary of how the, you know, how the multi chain ecosystem had
taken off, right, things were, there's a really burgeoning, you know,
within the Etherium ecosystem, but also outside of it. And there was
more and more infrastructure being built and more use cases, NF T's
really took off. And people really started to actually utilise a lot
of the infrastructure right, which was very different from 2017 2016,
when a lot of people speculated on one word would get used this time
around actually was real usage. The one thing that really kind of
stood out was how absolutely terrible the one that experience was,
right, this was every a lot of things felt very next gen and again,
like the UX had definitely improved quite a lot. But the wallets
still felt like, you know, totally left behind really felt like a non
windows 95 type equivalent. And, and, in the idea behind stakeholder
was initially to build a wallet that was, you know, usable across all
chains, it was going to be mobile first needed no setup. And we also
wanted to build around the concept of a fat wallet, which was very
much different from thin wallets, which wallets had has directly
been. So if you think about wallets, it's kind of like this very
utilitarian part of the stack, which basically just concerns itself
with three things, which is asset custody, key management and
transaction signing, right? Everything else kind of like happens
outside of the wallet. And you only use your wallet for these types
of you know, for these three activities, basically. And what we
wanted to do is we wanted to build something that actually had a
functionality natively accessible, right, we wanted, we wanted the
wallet to be something where users could do more than just, you know,
sign transactions, we wanted this to be something that you could go
to to easily perform some of the most important, you know, processes
in web three directly in the wallet itself. And we started with
staking because staking was, you know, on the one hand, extremely
important for the for the network's in terms of security. And you
know, getting getting users to easily participate was extremely
important at the protocol layer. But also in terms of yield, it's
actually one of the safest type of yields that you can get protocols
yield that is right, because you actually have revenues from the
protocols which are being distributed to users via staking.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And
so we wanted to, you know, we wanted to address that, because while
it was so important, it was also extremely broken, every protocol had
their own every chain had their own staking flow, you basically
needed to relearn it from scratch, every single time that you
interacted with a with a staking contract, you know, you had, you
know, some that person needed to bridge from one chain to the other.
And then you had like minimum staking requirements in terms of
minimum amounts. And some other ones, you actually had to activate a
stake after a certain period, and so on. So it was extremely broken,
which was an extreme asymmetry between importance and, and kind of
usability. So we wanted to tackle that first as the first sort of
native integration. And that's what we build out. We then kind of
like quickly went above and beyond just staking and we started to get
into liquid staking, we started to getting into into your vaults. So
we work together with yarn, and started to add your involves across
different protocols. And we started to add NFT support, we started to
have a Fiat on ramp natively accessible, etc. So, you know, we were,
we were kind of pushing the envelope in terms of like, what the
native native integrations were that we made accessible in the in the
wallet itself. However, the name steak wallet was still very much a
riff on, you know, staking being the first frontier of native
integrations. And so people, you know, first and foremost, a lot of
people got the the, you know, the food analogy, which was kind of bad
for SEO. So not a lot of people were actually able to find us when
they heard about us in passing. And then also people that actually
did get it felt that we were just, you know, the staking wallet. And
you know, while again, this was kind of like the first signature
piece of technology that we developed. And we're very proud of it, it
was also not the full scope, right, we really wanted to build a
wallet that was, you know, that really could do it all in one place.
Right. And so, this current release that we just we just brought to
market last week, you know, allows you to not just stake in three
taps across all protocols that we support, which is fully self
custodial, by the way, so there's a lot of heavy lifting under the
hood that's going on on the different SDKs that we support in order
to make that possible. So we are staking we have liquid staking we
have NFT supports across most of the protocols that we support. We
have now native registered swaps. So you can go from any EVM any
layer two and Solana bridge and swap in one transaction is extremely
smooth. We have ledger support so you can actually hook up your
ledger and leave all of your funds safely in your in your hardware
wallet while still having you know, your your NF T's accessible
wherever you go, and you can check your balances and easily perform,
you know, transactions if you if you just want to sign with your
ledger. And we also have, for instance, Ave v3, and hopefully support
it also in three taps. Extremely simple. So with that, you know,
without having so much more functionality and wanting to push the
envelope on what a wallet should be, it was kind of, you know, time
to rebrand. That's also what we went for Omni Omni chain on the asset
on the yield kind of everything in one place while being fully self
custodial. Right. So it took us one and a half years to get to this
point, but yeah, long answer for for why the rebrand. But yeah,
that's kind of the backstory.</p>

 10:49  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">No,
that was beautiful answer. It totally makes sense to its, I'm happy
actually how you tie that up, kind of in the in there. Because to me,
when I hear the word nominee I hear, you know, multi chain. I mean,
and you know, like, obviously, I think everyone knows that, you know,
at the end of the day, it's it's, it's a multi chain future, right?
Like, you know, as to me personally, as much as I love, you know, for
everyone's assets only live on Aetherium in arbitrary ways, know that
there are so many different options out there and so many different
chains that people choose to use. So it makes sense to give them the
option in that case. But also, like when you said also give them
options in terms of like in app features that maybe you can't what
you couldn't really access anywhere else. And I guess that kind of
leads me to my next question is like, Yeah, and you might you
mentioned a lot of it, potentially. But what would you say
differentiates Omni from other kind of just different wallets that
currently exist out there?</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
so I think, you know, and Alex, feel free to chime in here. But I
think for from my perspective, it's a radical focus on on reducing
complexity, right. So that's probably still one of the biggest
hurdles for web three adoption at large is things that are extremely
complex, that feel very, very manual. And if you want to do it,
right, if you want to reduce complexity, while still giving users
full ownership of their assets, meaning them, you know, managing
their own piece, that's very tough, right? That's also why, you know,
making things simple and easy to use, and making it seem like it's
web three, but not being web three, is very think is kind of, you
know, a very easy way of addressing this. And it's also very popular
with people people love, you know, things that are just easy to use.
That's why sci fi was as popular as it was right. And I think a lot
of people probably didn't either didn't know or didn't care, that
they were effectively handing over all of the crypto and you know,
lessons learned the hard way. But um, you know, removing complexity
and abstracting away complexity is kind of like what really
differentiates us and I think it has extremely important knock on
effects, right, because when you when you have complexity, you have
high barriers to entry, which means less people can participate,
which means, you know, the possible like the potential market cap is
radically reduced, which is, you know, bad for everybody. Also, when
you have complexity, you have a lot of risk, you have risk of like
signing the wrong transaction interacting with the wrong smart
contract. So if we bring something natively into the wallet itself,
such as interactions with a staking contract, we actually abstract
away, you know, the risk of you signing a wrong transaction, right.
So it makes the entire experience like the entire endeavour a lot
safer. You know, that risk to maybe also touch on that that risk,
obviously, also lead to higher churn rate, right? If you don't
address the risk, if you don't address the complexity, when people
interact with the wrong contract or get robbed, and get burned, you
know, there's a risk of them churning out of web three and say, this
is just not for me. Right, which, again, reduces the market cap even
further. So for us to address complexity, I think it's actually
extremely important for general adoption for for, you know, you know,
the market cap. And, you know, for users trust them in the ecosystem
that we're building. While you know, even if it's trustless, people
still need to trust that you know, that this is the right path
forward. So I think that's really the thing that really
differentiates us as abstracting away complexity, bringing things
natively into the wallet itself, and just making it extremely easy to
use.</p>

 14:10  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
I can also quickly jump in here. So from from my perspective, there's
another big difference with a lot of wallets is that we try and we
try to basically give every network you know, like a similar. We try
to give users on every network like a similar experience. So maybe,
you know, I think the the UX, pushed forward by wallets of previous
years, right was all about like switching active contexts and like
managing a network manually and for us, maybe some other wallets
right. When you switch network, you lose some features, and we try to
ship everything in like a truly multi chain way, right? Like that's
why that's why we have staking integrations across so many networks,
why we have NF T's across so many networks, like there's probably a
likely future for web three, where users like don't necessarily care
so much about the underlying network as long as they have their USDC
or They die and they can pay for their coffee in a coffee shop. Like
it doesn't necessarily matter if, of course, we love our sister on
Arbitron. Right, but it doesn't necessarily matter if they're on or
an optimism or one of these other alters. I think, also, like a big
part of our strategy for that. And how I've been talking about it
lately is like, Omni is kind of like a, we're, you know, we're
network, we're a network agnostic wallet, but we're also a virtual
machine agnostic wallet. And I think ultimately, like, we've kind of
like maybe set a standard here, and I think other wallets will
follow. As soon as they realise what we kind of realised last year. I
can kind of explain what I mean by that. But like, basically, right
now you have wallets right, that are scoped to like a virtual
machine, or in the worst case, like a single network. So just like
the example I gave Metamask, right? Yes, you have this network
picker, and you can choose all your different networks, and you can
use arbitration Aetherium, and avalanche and Phantom. The list goes
on, right, but you're really scoped to those EVM compatible networks.
There's, like, you know, the Phantom, the Solana extension wallet,
right? Like it only works with Solana and like, by extension, the
Solana VM. So these wallets, right, like, they're in thinking that
they've like hitched themselves to, and thinking that they're like,
aligned with the ecosystem, right, they've kind of like, mistakenly
hitched themselves to, to a VM. And whether or not that the end was
parasitic to like the network, they wanted to initially support. I
think like, that's like, looking at avalanche and Aetherium. Right
there. These are competing ecosystems and competing networks, but
Metamask supports both, like interchangeably, right. But if, for
example, like a causing Muslim, l to launches next week, Metamask
won't be in a position to support that, right, they don't have the
infrastructure, and all the users who want to use this new Aetherium
cause and wasn't able to, they're not going to be in a position to
use that. Whereas like Omni with our approach to like being
aggressively multi changed from beginning, we're a little bit of a
different situation where like, we can roll out a cause and Muslim
integration a lot easier. And then, you know, we can support all the
good things on that, on this network that's like additive to a
theorem, like staking and entities, etc. Whereas the I feel like
these other wallets, they will want to do this in the future, but
they've kind of like coded themselves into a corner early on.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Thank
you. Yeah, no, again, thank you for the again, very, very, very
thorough messaging. It's so funny, because I think it's like,
frightening for some people, it'd be, it'd be hard to follow that up
with a question. But I still have questions. I think what's very
interesting about your approach, obviously, is, like you said, it's
like, you know, you actually got to ended it off with a bear. But the
fact that you guys kind of thought with like that Omni kind of
setting from like, day one, and in a way, so that like, yeah, like
when you when you when you're scaling, it's like you, as you said,
you're not putting yourself into a corner where you can only support
specific chains, and, you know, sacrificing the UI and that way, I
guess, my cue, in terms of like, the design for the current Omni app,
because you guys spoke to it a lot already, is really kind of just
actually like scaling those integrations, in a world where there's
going to just be more and more chains, and even more and more daps on
those chains. Like every week, right? I mean, like, like, is there
kind of like, some sort of, I guess, like, I mean, I guess I'm just
wondering, like, how you guys plan on tackling the amount of daps and
stuff like that coming to these change, while being able to integrate
them in app and make them look beautiful? Hopefully, that question
makes sense.</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
no, no, totally, I think, you know, our approach is, we always want
to be a little bit careful, right? So we've actually built tremendous
speed, which is all, you know, credit to, to Alex, and, you know, our
tech team, you know, we've built on now 27 protocols with more depth,
within like, a little bit more than a year, compared to other teams,
which have, you know, barely achieved to do this in, you know, for
one chain. And I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to mark like any of
the of the new entrants into the space, I think a lot of like, new
wallet entrance, which is great, but, um, you know, more so
marketing, the, you know, the established players, which, which are,
you know, which I think is like holding back the entire ecosystem
tremendously. But the way that we're approaching it is, first and
foremost, we want to make sure that there's actually sufficient
infrastructure, that we actually have all the tools available to
serve as that, you know, that chain. That's, that's important. And
that's not just from, you know, an asset custody perspective. And
then a key management perspective, but again, also, you know, is
there an API that we can tap into in order for, for us to be able to
pull your NF T's from for instance, arbitrage into on the right side?
Are there any high fidelity lending platforms on the protocol which
we can utilise in order to bring the respective pools into the
wallet? You know, is there is there a good bridge that we can utilise
in order to allow users to easily you know, hop over from Chin Chin x
to the new chain that we just added? So, you know, having a
sufficient amount of infrastructure in place is critical. And then
obviously, it's also a question of, you know, what exactly is the
type of activity that is happening on that chain, there's some
chains, which are notorious for, you know, relatively low quality
projects being being launched. And, of course, we're a little bit
more careful servicing those chains, and would rather go, you know,
where that where there are high fidelity projects, building very
interesting stuff that we think our users would want to have easy,
you know, easy access to. So those are kind of the heuristics by
which we go. And then, you know, they're more fine grained questions
such as, you know, which which yield ball do we actually want to, you
know, integrate which, which lending, which and impulsive, we want to
service etc, which, which goes a little bit more into, into an
economics analysis. But yeah, from a high level, that's, that's kind
of what the heuristics that we apply to make decisions on which
chains to integrate and when.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">That
definitely makes sense. And I mean, I think it's, it's, I mean, I
don't know, it's a, it's just so funny, because I think like, the
longer I I've been in this space for a while myself, and you know,
it's just funny how you see kind of different chains in different
projects, obviously, come and go. And some obviously stay for the
long haul will sell or some others don't. And it's, you know, like, I
guess it's sometimes it's hard to make the like, specific decisions
that will end up enabling your project to do well, especially when
you're like, integrating so many like, like, when a lot of your
project really relies on integrating other projects, right? I mean,
chain, for example, like, you know, not only are we building
infrastructure on the base layer, but we're relying really a lot on
the community to build stuff that people like on the chain. So it's
an obviously, while it's very, very similarly to the way you guys
approach wallets, which is, which is why I think it's very cool. It's
almost like, I think, like, in a way, like we're wallets used to be
kind of like this thing that you plug in to use daps, you guys are
almost like taking the approach of like, your watch should be like
your home where the daps almost kind of like live within the wallet
itself, almost like someone would change crazy.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
totally not 100% of great, right. And I think if we if we take a look
at, you know, for instance, feedback, also from our users, what do
users really like about Omni, it's specifically those native
integrations, right, which, again, reducing complexity just means
it's easier to adopt, which is a net positive for the, for the
ecosystem. And again, you know, we spent so much time building this
out, we could have launched something a lot earlier, but we wanted to
build it the right way, and building it the right way, and giving
users full control over their assets, building this entire ecosystem
out, you know, in a way where it's not complex, but it's also fully
self custodial is just a lot harder, right. And I think it's, it's
not to toot our own horn here too much. But, you know, we always
wanted it to be built, right. And I think it's an important
foundation to any web three project to embrace that philosophy. And
even if that means that things are moving a tiny little bit slower,
we want them to be robust, and we don't want them to undermine the
core principles of web three, which at the end of the day, you know,
really ties all in to self sovereignty, right? People should own
their own assets, they should own their own identities. And they
should be able to transact freely with other self sovereign
participants in web three, right? And if you want to build that the
right way, it just takes time. But that has to there has to be done.
Right. So the only way that it's going to be sustainable.</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
I also think that I'm like, because we're so opinionated with how we
kind of like surface chains in our UI, we won't run into like, a lot
of the problems that the wallets that spun up and like 2017 and 2018
ran into, you know, we've talked to some of these other wallet
projects, right. And I mean, the wallet space is pretty small. So
it's easy and easy to get a hold of people and you run into each
other at conferences, and I mean, some wallets, supporting chains,
right? That they're basically ghost chains, right? They haven't had
transactions for months. But it's as a wallet. It's like, incredibly
kind of scary to like deprecate a chain, right? Like you're going to
annoy users yet to put up just negative messaging, you have to
provide a path for like, a migration for users. So we kind of like
maybe another way to like, look at change, we add an add and remove
support for us. Not necessarily like a full custody solution, right?
So for example, like application specific chains, right? That's what
even these are theory ml tools, like a lot of them are quite
application specific. And to a user, you don't necessarily You need
to say, Okay, here's this. Here's this entirely new chain, right. And
like, you can hold all your assets there, and you can do all the
stuff and there's no T's. And there's everything you can explore
there. It's like, oh, this is just a chain for lending. And what we
will do for you is if you choose to lend on this platform, we will
like move your assets for you lend them on that platform, and now
earning API, when you want to withdraw from there, we just, you know,
handle unwinding their position and transferring them back like
there's no, there doesn't need to necessarily be a concept of like a
fully fledged chain. That's like its whole own integration. It's just
like, oh, this is how you lend. Right? I think that's like a, that's
a good, that's like a opinionated approach, we took to UX quite
early. That's, for example, how some of our staking integrations
work, right, when we need to some of these networks we support, they
have like a separate consensus chain. And we don't even show the
users that that's like a separate network, right? We just handled
transferring the tokens for them. And now they're staking and when
they want to unwind, we just transfer the tokens back. But that kind
of can help with like chain fatigue, right? If there's a I don't
think it's can be like a difficult approach to make your world with
10,000 chains really, really approachable. This could be like one way
we go about things.</p>

totally agree. Yeah. And I think, in a way, it's like, it's like, one
thing that I've heard is actually a lot of people talking about,
especially, you know, on crypto Twitter, but like, kind of like
abstracting all that like all that away, but also still making sure
the user is at least somewhat informed about potential, like security
trade offs that they're using. You know, what, when they're using one
chain versus another, you know, I don't think there's a right answer
for that yet. But I'm truly interested to see how that's gonna be
tackled. I guess just the entire industry, you guys.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
for sure. I mean, this is like a little bit. I guess we're probably
showing our opinions as a wallet, right? Like, meta mask, for
example, right? It's very low level, right? There's like tutorials on
how you can basically add an RPC endpoint. For better or worse,
right? Like, it would be interesting to see if that was like a net
positive or net negative for meta mask users, that they were able to,
like, interact with all these other networks. I think from a self
sovereignty standpoint, right? It's obviously super positive. But
like, often these networks unless you're like, a super early adopter,
like often liquidity is very low for a reason. Yeah. I would say. I
think, our approach to that, I mean, like, to be honest, we'll
probably, we probably will just have like a liquidity threshold,
that's we've done it in the past, right? Like we don't, other than
terror, you know, which unfortunately, went down in flames for
everyone involved. Like, we don't have any networks that are like
super low on liquidity, or would be easily like 51% attackable. But
yeah, I think for us, we focus more maybe more on like smart
contracts, safety, right, like, adding ledger support. So So users,
like, see, phrases can be stolen, that kind of thing. But it's
definitely food for thought.</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But
I think it's also something that very nice embeds itself to get into
community more more closely involved, right. So we're still in the
early innings of, you know, building on the and bringing on new to
the market, but I think, you know, as, as web three literacy
increases, and as hopefully also, you know, coverage of security
benefits and trade offs, you know, becomes more easily accessible,
and understandable to most people, I think it's also something where
we can just, you know, let let the users vote on what exactly they
would want to, you know, integrate into a wallet, such as on the
right, and then we can make that chain easily serviceable, and it's
up to the user to decide, the user has to decide, you know, if they
feel like this train is sufficiently, you know, decentralised, that,
you know, if you were to completely abstract away any notion of which
chain you're currently transacting on, that this chain is still going
to be serviced. Right. And I think this is something where again,
having an engaged community you know, for for a while like us, but
also just in with three at large and for this to be directed
democratic. Those are just incredible benefits and I think, you know,
we can just kind of like crowdsource, you know, the intelligence on
on on how exactly we should go about, you know, adding support for
different chains and what users feel like it's, is sufficiently
decentralised or not, right. So again, I think ultimately, letting
this be a very directly democratic part. SS is probably the way to
go. And then, you know, our, our kind of like, you know, rolling this
and responsibility, and this is giving the users that we're servicing
and hopefully also beyond enough materials for them to easily
understand, you know, what, exactly what exactly those trade offs
are. And just, you know, that's also the reason why we produce a lot
of educational content. Today, we've written more than 130 articles.
And we tried to, you know, not just reduce complexity within the app
itself, but also outside of it such that when users look for, you
know, an answer to a very specific question, that they have a very
easy to digest article. And again, I think that educational
responsibility cannot be cannot be underestimated. And I think that,
you know, builds the foundation for for having a directly democratic
system in place for for how and when to add more functionality, more
chains.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Totally,
totally. I think I think at this point that it maybe it kind of makes
sense to, because more broadly, just touch on, like, what is a good
crypto wallet, you know, like, like, what does it provide today? And
you know, what features? I guess it's a good crypto wallet provider
in the future, I mean, hard question to answer, right, because we
don't, you know, crypto industry changes so fast that a year from
now, I'm sure it'll build, it'll be a completely different narrative
that we're tackling. But you guys have any thoughts on that, you
know, like, the crypto wallet live provides today, what provides in
the future potentially,</p>

 31:26  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I
can just kind of give you my personal take on this. And Alex's might
be a little different. But I think for me, it's about finding the
right balance, like a good wallet finds the right balance between
being a destination and also being a gateway. So think we have with
our native integrations we provide, again, just, I'm repeating this
over and over again. But it's just that's what we're about, right.
And that's why we spent so much time building, but those native
integrations are just extremely easy to use, you're in full control.
And, you know, once you once you, for instance, liquid state, you can
easily deposit, you know, a liquid acid into a lending pool and get
additional yield on it. So I think, you know, these types of
integrations are just are just super high value add in, they turned a
wallet into a sort of like destination where you don't necessarily
need to go beyond the wallet. And we're adding more integrations such
that you can do even more outside of bridging and swapping. And, you
know, buying crypto or lending it out, there's a lot more to come.
But I think that kind of positions the wallet as a destination. At
the same time, it's also important that the wallet is a gateway,
right? We don't want this to be paternalistic, where we tell the
users, here's what you can do and what you can't do. You know, we're
implicitly voting for what we find more important by integrating
things natively. But at the same time, we want to give users the
easiest possible way to participate in anything that lies beyond the
wallet, right? So we were actually one of the first wallets if not
the first wallet, and Alex can speak to that in more detail to
integrate support from wallet, wallet, connect V two. And, you know,
we're really pushing the boundaries and helping other you know,
protocols to think that the world can expect and having easy
accessibility of daps across various different chains, you know, with
for instance, wallet connect, and turning the wallet into a gateway
is also very important. So walking that kind of like fine line, I
think is very, very important. Now, and I think will only become more
important in the future as as web three girls.</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
I mean, I think from my perspective, basically the same right? I
think it's a wallet has got to basically cover all your, all your,
like immediate bases, right? Like you have to be able to, you
basically want like a sci fi experience, you want to be able to buy
your tokens, custody them safely, right. And I mean, like, I don't
think that like point of sale has really taken off for wallets yet,
but I think there will be another like magical experience for people.
But you know, previously before Omni like, the number one question I
kind of got when onboarding people into a crypto wallet, whichever
one it was, they would kind of always say, Okay, well, what now? You
know, and I think we've like very nicely answered that what now
question I think there's so much you can do once you have a wallet.
You know, everyone has that like, again, that medical medical
experience right of like, swapping on uni swap. It's kind of amazing
that you can do this without like without taking a photo of your
driver's licence right and uploading it to some platform. I think
similarly, like the recent NFT craze, right? This is also something
that like touches people have touches people's hearts when they can
like own something. And then with Omni like they can also flex it
right like we have a tonne of home screen real estate like dedicated
to NF T's because we just think that it's like such a cool thing that
you can truly own like these decent these pieces of art which are
like hopefully hosted on like some decentralised server. And no one
can kind of take that away from you to the I think so. You know this
what Now question is like also kind of what well, it's all about
like, you can basically Nowadays, you can basically bring your wallet
to any decentralised application via the power of wallet connect and
like do everything you would do. It's basically just as good as like
a browser extension wallet with the two, right, which were like a
very keen supporter of that'll, it'll just be that on steroids,
right? Like all of your favourite like VM independent applications,
right? Can be used by a wallet connect so you can do your swaps on on
Sabre like a Solana DAP, you can you can buy an NFT on a near via
near smart contract, right? And then you can come back to the
Etherium, and land on RV or something. So I think for a while, you've
got to cover the bases. And then you've got to also answer that.
What's next question?</p>

 35:45  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I am
totally aligned, especially with that with that, what's next
question? It's, it's funny, I think, actually, on the last space that
we had, we were speaking with GM X and dope x. And so when it came up
from the crowd, and asked, you know, like, from a user perspective,
it's, it's sometimes a little difficult to like to know, but I can
kind of interact with both of these depths and like, you know, you
know, use one and then kind of jump and use another one and then have
the both complement each other. And I think the the person had
mentioned that, like, it'd be very, it'd be very, how do you say, the
very convenient if there was like some sort of like a death mall,
they think the thing was the way they described it, where it's like,
you have like multiple dabs within like, one UI or one setting. And
you can kind of just, you know, click a button and kind of, maybe go
leverage long on something, and then click the button next to it and
maybe, you know, like, hedge with, like, you know, like, with an
options trade, for example. And it's, it's interesting, because, in a
way, that's kind of how I honestly, that's kind of how like
centralised finance works a little bit right now, like, for example,
if anyone has like a, like a Robin Hood account, right? You think
about it, like the your quote unquote, wallet is literally in the
app. And then obviously, if you want to buy something, you know,
let's say you want to swap or something, essentially is what it is in
crypto, you would just go ahead and search out the the stock you want
to buy and buy it right away. Right. So that what Now question is so
interesting, and it's just so funny how to me, I guess it's more of
like a business question. At the end of the day, if you yourself want
to build something, I guess, or if you want to integrate someone
else's product. So many thoughts racing through the head right now?</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
I think I think actually, that question is for us. And it's a very,
very clear answer. We do not want to build any infrastructure, or any
daps or any anything of that sort ourselves, right? We really see
ourselves as like our our mission is to remove friction from access,
making things just very, very easy for users to interact with.
That's, that's really what we're about, right? We're building that,
that consumer touchpoints that makes all of that very easily
accessible. We definitely at no point in time want to cannibalise the
market that we're ultimately trying to serve. Right? I think that'd
be, that'd be a huge mistake, if we started to all of a sudden built,
you know, yield vaults ourselves, because we can just skim that extra
percentage off the top, I think that would immediately undermine the,
you know, the, that will immediately undermine everything that we're
rebuilding and our reputation. So I think ultimately, for us, is just
working with the people that are building amazing stuff, and just
making it even easier for people to get involved in whatever that is
that is being built. And, and hopefully bring it out to the masses,
right? That's what we really see us as doing.</p>

on that note of kind of, you know, just me just even mentioning sci
fi, I guess. What do you guys think the future holds for platforms? I
guess you could say like Robinhood. Like, again, centralised finance
applications. If we do if we are essentially approaching a world
where wallets are going to honestly take more of the Omni approach
where like, you know, you're integrating everything in app, and
you're just trying to make a more curated experience, you know, for
the user at the end of the day.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
I think I think there's a lot of there are a lot of lessons from sci
fi, right? It can't be underestimated how appealing that value
proposition was to a lot of people. It's very, very clear from like,
a first principles perspective, that, you know, web three is of
immense interest to a lot of people a lot more people than, you know,
our industry concurrently service, right. And that goes to speak how,
you know, fed up people are with the web to infrastructure structure,
there's just so centralised and effectively disowns people have, you
know, their assets of their identities and you know, where we're
artists got squashed for producing amazing art. And effectively, you
know, God got zero upside from the content being replicated, you
know, to the to the entity the entire time and yeah, so think you
know, for for for sci fi, though, you know, taking those learnings
and seeing how people really place an emphasis on ease of
accessibility. I think bit by bit sci fi platforms are going to
become absolutely irrelevant because you have platforms such as ours
that effectively give you the same level of convenience. It's, but
you know, don't underestimate don't undermine your self sovereignty
by even a fraction of a percent. Right. And that's also that's,
that's really our mission, making it as easy as sci fi, but it being
fully defined. And again, it's a lot harder to build. But ultimately,
I think this is the only sustainable way for us to build web three,
and get everybody into web three. Right? So sci fi platforms,
interesting learning, unfortunately, also lesson learned the hard
way. But But accessibility, ease of use is so extremely important to
so many people. And we really want to make sure that we can deliver
that while not under will not undermining any, you know, any
components in the in the principles of</p>

three. Yeah, so the question was basically like, what does the future
hold? Right for wallet? And I think for winter it lighter I think now
that I mean, maybe it's like sacrilege to say, but I feel like we're,
you know, squarely back into the bear market. Right. And so it's
like, I feel like each bull market is a good time to look back and
see how different the industry was compared to last time. And I think
the next bull market I think it'll, you know, that will look like
that will be a little bit closer to what mass adoption will look
like, right? I think social media, right, we're starting to see a few
of these pop up that are actually like, actually, like decentralised
social media platforms where like, people can't be D platformed.
There are lots of lots of discussions around like, I you know, I
think identity for NF T's has always been like long talked about
right, but now there are a lot of standards coming through which
actually, like have a bit of weight behind them. I think like those
examples you just mentioned of DMX and dog pics, right? These are
really powerful trading tools and it would actually be interesting to
see some of sci fi like now that it's blown up time and time again,
move over into defy right. And I think like there's a lot of it's
also such as the you know, the barriers to entry are so much lower.
In defy that, like, we have a lot of smart people coming out of
school right now looking at job offers from from Prop shops and sci
fi institutions, and they just think to themselves, you know, we have
flash loans, I can, like do this from my bedroom, make tonnes of
money and contribute to this decentralised world. So I think it's all
like an infrastructure problem at the end of the day, like as like
infrastructure, you know, as like a rising tide. And I think we'll
see that in spades. Next Bull Run, where everything is super easy to
use metal finally even get point of sale. Like I would love to buy my
morning coffee with them with crypto bud. Um, I think we're getting

contact with them is extremely important. So we've actually been
starting to do more, you know, user interviews, where we're just
sitting down with users one on one and getting their take on what
they like, and where they would like to see it go. And I think
that's, you know, the further we grow, and the more users we serve as
the more important this, this becomes. So think, for us to build a
strong community of vocal community, and for them to give us feedback
and ultimately down the road probably also vote on things directly,
it's just going to become more and more important. And again, for us,
it's about building it around the community that we're looking to
service. And and those are the people that we also want to be
accountable to and we want to listen to and build this for.</p>

sucks and like let's make it a bit better. And now that we have a
wallet was so much functionality. I think it's a great time for us to
like also talk, talk to people and see what they like So what they
don't like about our product, I'm personally like, super excited over
the next few months to see now that we have finally released on me,
right, so much like blood, sweat and tears have gotten to this thing.
I'm just super keen to see what people actually have to say about it.</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And
actually actually want to tie that into something hunter that you
mentioned earlier, which is, you know, people still wanting to be
still wanting to kind of know, which chains, their transactions are
being routed via, et cetera, and how do we exactly arrive at, you
know, a consensus around what is sufficiently decentralised? And
should we be servicing that chain and community involvement at that?
I just want to say that, you know, I really, really appreciate the
support from from arbitrators side, because, you know, it's, I think
it's a little counterintuitive for, you know, for a protocol like,
like arbitration to be, you know, super excited, per se, about a
multi chain wallet, versus like a fully dedicated wallet. But I think
ultimately, you know, it's also a pretty beautiful notion, because
the protocol layer is very meritocratic, people will go wherever the
best tech is, right. And I think in order for that to be possible,
you need to have an infrastructure where users can easily hop over.
And I think a very important term that doesn't get talked about
enough is cross pollination, right? Ultimately, when you take a look
back at the early, you know, alternative likelier ones, and 2016 2017
ish, there was so much tribalism, and everybody was trying to be an
even now, like, within the previous like, you know, multi channel,
and everybody was just talking about, like, youth killers, etc. And I
think that's just a very misguided and dangerous notion, because at
the end of the day, we all want to build web three together. And this
is such like, our, our entire, like, our total addressable market is
virtually anything digital, right. And it's such a powerful and
beautiful vision, you know, that users can own their own identities
can own their own assets, and we should all be, you know, working
towards this goal and seeing how things have become more composable
over time, and, you know, you talking about, for instance, this depth
wall, things, just seamlessly plugging together, even though it was
built by two totally different teams, and it's accessible to anybody
anywhere in the world. You know, that's such a powerful vision. And
ultimately, you know, I think at the protocol layer is going to be
entirely meritocratic, whoever built the tech, like the best tech is
going to win. And I think it's also, you know, teams like arbitration
that are embracing a multi chain future that are not afraid of it,
but that are excited about it, are the ones that actually, you know,
implicitly just show their their their confidence and their own
abilities to build this and what they have already built. And so I
just want to say a huge thank you for that. And I think it's at the,
at the sort of, like, it's a very foundational piece for making web
three really work. Because it's not about tribalism, it's about, you
know, building around this common concept of self sovereignty. So,
really appreciate that. And again, that's kind of like what we're
trying to do from the wallet side is make that you know, more and
more accessible and get people involved without undermining the core
principles of web three.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Again,
totally, totally, and the course appreciate it. I mean, it's, it's a,
it's a very interesting space to be in, I'll tell you that much. I
mean, you go into so many different conferences, and being at being
in crypto for a while, like, you guys definitely know. It's like,
yeah, like the, I guess you could say, I hate to say that word, but
you know, like, like, the vibe of the space tends to change over
time. But, you know, at the end of the day, it's like, most people
kind of just see this as like, okay, like, you know, it's pretty much
your bag is against mine. I think that's what the core like a lot of
people kind of like that's where like the tribalism comes from, at
least from what I've seen. But ya know, as long as we have, like,
those core principles in mind, just, you know, making sure the tech
is there, and making sure the UI is there for when we want to onboard
like the next, as they say, like, you know, a million users. That's
all it really matters, you know,</p>

 48:43  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for
sure, but the thing is, like, you know, that's exactly that
perspective, which is very short term and very zero sum, right? Like,
this is not and this is also why it's important to get more people
into it three, it's not because it's just, you know, a game of like,
who's holding the bag. It's about, again, just bringing, bringing art
technology to more more people in actual usage of the protocols will
lead to, you know, the backs increasing and insights, right. So this
is it's something where, if we're building this in a meritocratic
way, you know, virtually everybody can win, if we are sticking to the
foundations that we're really building around with web three. Right?
So I totally understand. I mean, this is the reality that it's a lot
of like your back versus my back. But I think it's it's, it's, you
know, we all need to kind of like try to go beyond that narrative, in
order to see that what's really at stake here is bringing digital
freedom to virtually everybody. And if we all play our part, it's a
win win for everybody. Right? It's not a zero sum game. So, yeah. You
know, again, tough in the short term, but that's really I think, what
the bar should be in terms of like, medium to long term.</p>

100% Agreed. On that medium to long term note. Is there any anything
that you guys can give us on like the roadmap of Omni I know you
mentioned you really want to be focusing on user feedback and stuff.

 50:05  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah.
I mean, where to begin? Right, I think, you know, having just put out
such a, like such a huge amount of work into the market, we were,
like, as we already said, super receptive to feedback, and we'll be
spending, you know, a little bit of time, before we get back to our
normal shipping schedule, just to make sure that like, what we've put
out is like 100% polished, but looking forward, I mean, there's so
many, there's a tonne of low hanging fruit. Right, I think we, you
know, when we kind of think about AI, before, you just mentioned
onboarding the next million users, but I think I think the actual
saying is onboarding the next billion. And when I think about
onboarding the next billion users, I'm not totally sure that, you
know, seed phrases are going to be or ledger devices are going to be
the way to do it. You know, I think, you know, that, those two
options, right, you cut out everyone who doesn't have like 100 bucks
to spend on a ledger, and you cut out all the illiterate people,
right? So I think what we're even though we're like mobile first, I
think we can do better. So yeah, we're looking a lot at things such
as like, account abstraction, right? NPC wallets, anything that
basically makes it easier for users to like, have a one click spin
up, signing guardians, safely signing transactions, that kind of
thing. With play played around with, you know, this is definitely
yeah, I would say like, that's probably on the side of extremely
cool, but like extremely technical and nerdy. And I think on the
other side, you know, we also want to have fun, right? I think we've
been looking at kind of an interesting concept. We've built some
internal proof of concepts with right where you basically spin up.
The minute you that the minute you set up your Omni wallet, you will
basically be given a MySpace kind of like web profile, which you
could then customise right, with all your multi chain of teams, you
can send music to it, that kind of thing. That's kind of, you know,
that that kind of thing is just like incredibly cool, but maybe like
less objectively useful than MPC wallets. I think, now that we also
have. So we recently recently relaunched launched our bridging tech,
right, which is pretty cool. So how it kind of works is we use like
these bridge index aggregators behind the scenes. So given a request,
right, go from, say, USDC, on Albert from to uni on eath. Right, we
can hopefully, like provide your route by our providers, and like
kind of just happens seamlessly. And we also have like Dexter's on
Solana, but we really want to, like, go beyond that, right? And just,
again, like give users the option to just go anywhere and do
anything. So that means like, bridging, bridging and swapping and
more obscure chains, right? We want to kind of just not be so
opinionated about just EVM and Solana, but give people the option to
go, I don't know, near tears us, Cosmos, that kind of thing.
Honestly, we could go on forever about our roadmap, but um, I think
that's like some things were immediately thinking about.</p>

 53:19  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
and also like some more experimental stuff, right, I think a little
bit more, like medium term, not necessarily super short term. Also
things such as, you know, like, decentralised chat apps, right. I
think that, especially with web three identities and like ens, etc.
Turning, turning blockchain into an into a disruptor. For instance,
WhatsApp is just such a low hanging fruit. And, and servicing
something like that directly through the wallet. I think it's
actually very, very cool, right? Because you'll have all of your
assets there, all of your tokens and NF T's and you can move
everything around. But be very, very cool if you can then also
directly communicate with other wallets. Right? I think the more
we're seeing web three kind of go into established web two use cases,
the more interesting this will also become to adopt for, you know,
for people that may not have, you know, any ease at all at this point
in time. So think for us to also build around those use cases that a
little bit more future forward. It's also going to be exciting, you
know, kind of like later q4, early, early q1 next year and beyond.
And, yeah, we really want to push the envelope in terms of you know,
what a wallet wallet is, what it what it should be and what it can
be. And, yeah, again, we want to do all of this while giving users
full control. So we got a lot of exciting stuff coming up.</p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Hey,
guys, I just had a quick question. Lion Meister mentioned previously
regarding, you know, like cross pollination, which I totally agree
with amongst communities, and how we're all trying to kind of push
the web three, space forward as a whole. My question, I guess, is
more concerning. Would you say that there are certain layer one
blockchains or alternative blockchains that are trying to solve the
speed and scalability issue that aren't necessarily, you know, the
best for new users? Like maybe there's certain blockchains that
aren't really pushing the overall agenda of this space forward?</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lionmeister.eth
 57:03  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
totally. I think this goes back to the question of what's
sufficiently decentralised. Right. And obviously, there is an
immediate trade off between finality and, you know, degrees of
decentralisation. So that's also why, you know, we're obviously so
bullish on layer twos, like arbitrary. But um, I think I think
outside of the question of like, insufficient degrees of
decentralisation, which we're still addressing in house at the
moment, and for which we will get our community more involved to make
those decisions with us in the future. I think it's also just a
question of, you know, what exactly can you do on these on these
blockchains? Right, when would it be too early to add support, for
instance, some of the new blockchains that are jumping up right now.
So I mean, Abelson, Suey, and some of these others and say have like,
raised crazy amounts of, of venture capital before even having
shipped anything meaningful towards main net. And, you know, the
thing is, like, you know, of course, we could try to add support as
soon as possible. And obviously, from a business perspective, it's
not uninteresting for us to use it as a quote unquote, Greenfield
opportunity and be one of the first wallets. But that being said, I
think, you know, we really would want to make sure that things are
actually robust enough for people to, you know, use them more easily.
We kind of want to see, you know, how is what is being built? How is
it being built, what is being built by other protocols with by other
daps that are building on top of it? What is the kind of musical
weather that attracts, and, you know, again, a sink for us to add
support is, you know, natively is a kind of like implicit nod of
approval from our side, right, we're not saying, Oh, this, this chain
is great, like, do everything on this chain from now on. But if we
make it more easily accessible, of course, there's a certain amount
of work that we're taking on from our site and work to make it
accessible. So by us making that investment, we are kind of like
voting with our, with our, with our time with our resources. So I
think we want to be a little bit careful, and just kind of see how
things are built and what is being built. And, and yeah, I think that
also like, you know, economic questions, such as, you know, what are
the economics of the of the specific chance, right? Is there actual
revenue redistribution happening for for instance, staking, or is
this primarily inflation that is being pumped into the market? Right.
And I think that's specifically something to watch out for with App
chance that can kind of like set their own economic parameters. But
yeah, again, I think for us, try to try to assess this from a first
principles perspective around the core concepts of web three, and
then just seeing how robust the infrastructure is. That's probably
probably most important in the short term. And then the further we go
along, the more important it is to get our users involved in the
process and getting them to vote on it too, because we don't want to,
you know, make, make all the decisions on their behalf, right. We
don't want to be too, too patriarchal and overreaching. So A very
fine line</p>

 1:00:07  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah,
also, maybe Sorry, I just have one more thing to add there. I think
like, there's a another good example, right of like a huge network,
you know, backed by one of the biggest centralised exchanges, right,
which I think everyone here would agree like, it's maybe not the most
decentralised platform out there. But you know, you can't, but it
can't be understated, right? How many people that that network on
boarded into web three, right, taught them the basics. And from
there, they've gone on to do like, you know, maybe bigger and better
things and other more secure and, or faster or more distributed
networks? So at a certain point, right, like, if you're not
decentralised, like what are we really doing? Right? You may just,
you may as well just have a database. But I think there is a space,
like it's all it's always a range, right? It's always a spectrum. And
I think, yeah, there's definitely value in being on the more
centralised spectrum, more centralised side of the spectrum.</p>

 1:01:05  
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Totally.
And also like maybe to tie this sorry, not to make this like overly
convoluted here. But it's actually it's a super important question,
right. And coming back to the concept of cross pollination, with what
Alex just mentioned, and, you know, different chains are in different
parts of the lifecycle of people's journey into web three. And so the
concept of cross pollination is also one of allowing people to kind
of like graduate from one chain to another, right. And also
understanding that this is an incremental process. So if you were on
boarded by a chain, that might be very fast, but not sufficiently
decentralised. The more you kind of like venture into web three, the
more you'll understand how important, you know, sufficient
decentralisation actually is, and you might want to then, you know,
go from one chain to another chain, and for us to be able to easily
service that is also important, right? For the for the for the space
as a whole. So yeah, it's not a, it's a very complicated question
with a lot of nuances. And and I think for us, it's about making
prudent decisions and seeing how we can best service these types of
use cases without, you know, over endorsing them and, you know,
making it seem like, you know, we want our users to particularly
perform a lot of the transactions on that chain versus other chains.
So yeah, it's it's a balancing act.</p>

talked with a lot of teams in the space and a lot of a lot of
protocols. And I think we have the luxury of being involved in in
virtually every ecosystem. So I think those kinds of like,
conversations come up naturally. And again, very, very important to
address because they might not have an immediate impact right now in
the short term. But we need to build it in a way that if this becomes
massively successful, that of course, we have all these questions
answered right from the get go. Right. So having the, you know, your
