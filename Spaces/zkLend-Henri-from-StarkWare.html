everyone again, or for those of you joining our Twitter spaces for
the first time. welcome. I'm Jane and I'm one of the co founders and
CO project leads of z k land as well as your host for today. I have
the pleasure of having Henry on today. And Henry is actually the
developer advocate for Stark were to kickstart our series three Stark
where our stock net educators series for Zen and friends AMA. And so
I guess without further ado, I will pass it on to Henry to introduce
himself and tell us a little bit more about his background and his
role at Star in stark ware. But before that, one thing I forgot to
mention is what I'm really excited about today's ama is that you know
in the past, we've really focused on projects and the builders
experience. For this series specifically, we are zooming on zooming
in on individuals who have been very active in the stock where or
stock in that ecosystem. And so this is really our chance to both get
to know them on a personal level, but also understand a little bit
better about the type of work that they've been doing. So without
further ado, I will pass it on to Henry tissues himself.</font></p>

It's cooler and honour to to to be Yeah, it's really nice. So my name
is Henry. I work at software as a developer advocate for Stark nets.
My background is in. I studied engineering for five years in France.
I specialise in embedded systems. And when I was in engineering
school, I really didn't like coding. And I didn't really like
technical stuff. So after that, I went on and studied for three more
years at a business school. And when I started business school, there
were some interesting stuff, but for some reason, on my free time, I
was going back to technical stuff. So that's what I did. I mostly
learned technical stuff on my, on my free time. After that, I worked
for a while in the telecommunication industry, I worked for a French
company was selling software to target a communication network. And I
spent about three years in the broader America zone in between the US
and Brazil and South America at large. And at that time that I fell
into the crypto rabbit hole. And then I started working with free
works a bit in the insurance industry on how can you use what kind of
blockchain do for in for insurance? And then after a while, what can
insurance do for the blockchain industry? That was interesting. And
then I joined starker about 10 months ago. As a developer advocate,
on dimension also, I teach at a French in university, one day a week.
So I teach people in fourth and fifth year, the curriculum has grown
a bit along the Europe, but broadly, we get to Bitcoin Aetherium. And
defy, broadly what we cover and probably next semester, and kind of
start covering stagnate a bit.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">That's
great. Thanks a lot, Henry. And I guess specifically, what I'm really
curious about is 10 months ago, stock where it was probably still, I
mean, it's pretty well known because of stock x, but I would say, not
in most people's radar or not on most people's radar. How did you
actually get to meet the team? who's based in Israel, and we just had
all of the startup startup?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Henri
 17:29</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
it's a funny story, actually. So my brother works in web two. And
long time ago, he worked with Louis Goodman, who is now at Stark
where and when I was in two or three, my brother's the captain Romeo,
I have a friend was working with free. So what is working on salaries
at starboard? Have I Oh, yeah, I know, the company. They do
interesting stuff. They don't know, I didn't know much stuff about
Star Wars. And I knew it was about Zekey things. And I knew on a very
shallow level, what Z k was for mostly for privacy, but I didn't
really have time to dive more. And then when I was starting to look
at how to like I was in the insurance sector, and I wanted to go to
full, like, I wanted to be full on web three. I was working all my
days on web three, but I wanted to be into web three native company.
So when I started living into that, my brother say you should grab a
coffee with Louie. And we did and, and I remember Louie saying, Yeah,
so we're starker now. Oh, yeah. You you're working on Zika roll ups.
I didn't really know what they were and but you don't have anything
in production yet. And we told me Yeah, we do. We have stock X, and
it's doing millions of volume. And so basically, after that
conversation, I looked a bit more into what software was was doing.
And I, I remember having this kind of FOMO. Because I, I've been
around for a while. A while doesn't mean much in our industry,
because it's so young. But what I mean is like, I'm fairly
conservative in the blockchains, I'd look at because there is so many
things being built by so many people that it's really hard to figure
out what is interesting, and what is vaporware. And so I don't spend
a lot of time outside of bigger project like Bitcoin and Aetherium.
But I looked a bit into what software was doing. And I realised that
it was not like other projects where basically, you know, you take
what other networks have done, you change a few variables, change a
few parameter parameters, maybe change a bit the consensus outdoors
and maybe compress your transaction in a different way and you get
incremental change. I realised there was a real breakthrough at its
core, which was 00 Knowledge proof or validity proofs and that got me
really like really interested. And after that, you know, we kept
talking and eventually I joined the team as dev advocate.</font></p>

think these stories are the best. It's really fun, because like,
we're a very niche industry and a very fringe one, and on a lot of

So he out he actually convinced me, but he works on the other side of

side of things. So you know, when you have family that only talks
about web three, and only talks about, you know, these types of
things at the dinner table, you know, you automatically become more
interested in the space. Yeah, but Hey, enough about me, let's talk a
little bit more about you. Okay, so So that's great to know, kind of
your journey and to start work, can you? Can you share with me a
little bit more about kind of your role as a developer advocate?
Specifically, you know, what I would love to know is what you do, but
could you tell me a little bit more about a day in the life of Henry?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

 21:44</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
sure. So usually, the first thing I do in the morning is dressed the
kids and drove them to school is a good part of my day. And then I
work from home. So I go back home, and then I turn on my computer.
And then you know, the content of my day at Starbucks like that. What
I do with my kids is mostly the invariants of my day, because what I
do is start where it really depends on the periods. In the when we're
preparing, for example, for conferences, we I would prepare a
presentation. So find an interesting topic I want to present and then
prepare the slides or coordinate, who will be where, who we should
meet, which projects will be present. And we we should talk with them
to try to get them to to work on starting out. Because like the
overall goal, my goal is to get more people to build on stock net. I
think it's a cool platform. And I want to explain to people why it's
interesting, and what they can build with it. Like, the possibilities
of STUXnet are so much broader than what you can do on other
blockchains that like my job is basically to help share this
excitement with people so that they can they build more things. So it
includes preparing for conferences, sometimes it includes writing
tutorials, so you know, sometimes ideas or you could do that on Stark
net, hideaway explain it. And there's often the best way to explain
it is just to throw together a bit, a few lines of code and then
publish it as a repo so that people can play with it. So a good part
of it is is that then another part of it is organising events and
meetups. So there are the events are organised around where I am. But
there are some people on the other side of the planet to say, hey,
starting it is nice. When do you guys organise a meetup to which we
often say, Well organise it, you can organise it yourself, and we'll
help you. So we provide assistance, we provide presentation content,
we send swag to them so that they can distribute it. And these kind
of things are surprisingly time consuming, just you know, figuring
out how to send 30 or 30 T shirts back to people on the other side of
the of the world can no way there's a lot of small things you need to
do in order to do that. You know, there was a big conference in Paris
in July, and I spent a large one that I want to admit amount of time
in the month before to figure out how we could do some start next
year. But I managed to do it. So I was happy I did. So yeah, a lot of
it, I would say between a third between a 10th. And a third of my
time is spent on call talking with builders. And then another
participant on calls with the team. And then the rest is reading
stuff and coding stuff. I would say</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">that's

it's really variable this or trying to figure out why cons make this
tutorial work. And it's because I, the last time I death was with
another version of Cairo, so I have to update it. And then I figure
out things that don't work. And so I talked with the product team to
say, Hey, guys, this maybe we need to make better for other reasons.
So it really depends.</font></p>

shirts for shirts, you know, it's not necessarily things like, oh,
getting things through customs. It's like, for example, you receive
the box with 300 T shirts, and you have a meet up tomorrow. And so
you need to pick like, what 30 to go there. And then you open the box
figure, I can just take 30, right? Nope, turns out, they're all
mixed. And you need a bit of every size. If you take 30 randomly,
probably, you'll get either 30 were very small, or 40 are very large,
and nobody's going to be happy. So just some stupid stuff such as,
okay, let's say 300 shirts and start to sort them by size. Anyway,

yeah, that's great. And I guess I have a follow up question to that.
In terms of, you know, with with Stark net, right, like 10 months
ago, Cairo, there were, I would say, a few resources out there. And,
you know, a lot of the new developers relied on a lot of your
resources. But now, you know, there are a lot more resources out
there, be it like in code only does or just even other projects that
are building out own resources for developers? Would you say that,
you know, in terms of the nature of your role has actually changed
over the past 10 months?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Henri
 26:39</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
for sure did. But I'm not sure. Like, if you go from the basic of
what my role is, which is to get people to learn about Stark ware,
about Stark net, and start building on top of it, this hasn't changed
that much. But the implementation did. Because yeah, there was a lot
of content missing a few months ago, now, it's a lot of people are
sticking, stepping up, which is great. Now, there's not a lot of
meetup groups, so we need to have them and get them going.
Eventually, this will they will have their own legs. And this is not
something I'll spend as much time on. So yeah, definitely. A few
months back, a lot of work implemented in involves creating a lot of
content. And now it's more about interacting with people who do and
organise conferences, I would say, so yeah, this, this has changed
quite a bit. And yeah, I was gonna say something and then I forgot.
Okay.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">No
worries. And I guess along those same lines, right, what do you see
as kind of some very unique challenges of being a developer advocate
of Stark debt? Versus let's just say, another ecosystem?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Henri
 28:02</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
I think that stark net is very different as a very different
developer experience than anything you might have in the WordPress
space. So take, if you take web three, it's a very niche sector,
there's not a lot of us. And onboarding people from one to two, were
free took a lot of time. And now everybody's used with the dominant
ecosystem, which is basically the VM, right, which is Aetherium. And
like the developer experiences around the EVM. And going away from
the means that a lot of the work that other people did we can't
capitalise on and this work is, say, in tooling, you can't use the
same tools right off the bat. And our tools, the tooling we have
starting at right now are still a bit more clunky, or their their
errors are harder to debug. And they're a bit slower than what what
you have on Aetherium. They're more or less where Tyrion was four to
five years ago. But also for other stuff, such as you know, content,
you mentioned content. Now, there are people writing content, but
it's not like there's as much content for Starclan than there is 14
of them. So if you want to develop on any kind of EVM chain, you can
capitalise on all the content that is available for all the rover
ecosystems. So we have to redo a lot of this work, the so that's
where the challenge now for the opportunity. And what's great is that
we have the eyesight of four or five years of how it happened on
Aetherium, we can see which tools turned out to be useful, which
tools or concepts turned out to be useless so we can go a bit far
faster in implementing them. We can see teaching matters that works.
That works, others that didn't. And also the other great opportunity
Do we have is that the platform is different as a developer developer
experience, but it also allows new stuff. And so I think that, that,
that outlining this is art, but it's also great assets. Because once
people understand that they can do stuff on stock that they can't do
elsewhere. Usually, they're locked in, you know, I found what I was
going to say earlier, you mentioned what changed in my role. I would
say that we a few months back, we really missed some key basic
things, we still do, we still need to make the documentation better
for you, for example, but in a lot of what I did was around that.
Now, what I do, I tend to think that our priority, and my priority at
least is to keep people excited about stack NET developers experience
is still a bit hard and is going to stay with harder than elsewhere
for for a little while. It's not going to improve overnight. It will,
but it won't improve overnight. And so what matters is keeping people
excited, keep them keeping people with their eyes on the prize and
keeping people I think people keep in mind that the groundbreaking
stuff that you concentrate with doing a new anywhere else that you
can do on stack net, and you can do elsewhere. That's that's what I
would consider my pro priority today.</font></p>

yeah, there are definitely some differences, I would say. I think our
devs overall are curious. They wouldn't be here otherwise, nobody. I
mean, nobody would spend the amount of tiny to spend on current stock
net. If they weren't a bit curious about what they can do. I think
this will change in the future. But for now, codev Mostly, they're
resilient, meaning that when they face an error, or something that
doesn't work, they're able to look for an answer. They're able to try
to make things worse. So they're like, they're really like, trying to
they're really trying to make like, yeah, basically makes things

characteristic they have which I this what I would say, and then it's
really hard to categorise, but I would say that Cairo days on in
general, fall on both extremes of the experience curve for dev, you
have very new devs and very experienced there. So for very new dev, I
was actually very surprised to see this, but we have regularly people
who suck for some people who never programmed before, and they want
to start with Cairo, or you have people who are new to web three, and
start with Cairo. So these people, sometimes they think they Oh, so
it is too crowded. Let me try a new ecosystem. And sometimes they
take the stockinette randomly, sometimes not. But did start with
Cairo. And I was surprised that we have a decent amount of these

there's there's a large amount of them. I think, Lonzo from brick
also never did solidity. And there are a bunch of other is from
friends land. Also never never wrote anything in solidity. I mean, by
little by little they know. They get to interact, the solidity code,
they know more or less their way around it. But it's not like they're
not language. They have way more familiar with code and solidity. And
then on the other side of the curve, there's there are some very
experimented devs. So some people were writing code in solidity for
five years ago, sometimes longer. And they're not afraid of having
tooling breaking. They know that they're used to having a developer
experience where things don't work that well. I mean, like the core
work But it's rickety, and it's hard to use, but they see the
promise. And the people who are working on Cairo today are the same
kind of people who work on solidity five years ago, where everybody
was on Bitcoin. And it wasn't really clear what you could do with
Aetherium. And it took a while to find some actual application. But
people stuck around because the possibilities were interesting. It's
kind of the same thing with curl. So we have, I think, broadly,
people fall into one of these two buckets. And a lot of developer in
Aetherium, fall into the bucket of they're very good. With web three,
they're very good with solidity they write very interesting code. But
what they're trying to do, their main focus today is getting on as
many chains as possible. So their goal is to Yeah, be on as many
chains as possible. And us not being EVM compatible, makes it not an
interesting return on investment, because they want something where
they can reuse all the code they have. And it's harder to do that
with with stagnant. So all of these deaths were very good. We tend
not to see them that much in our ecosystem. I think that's a shame
because they know a lot of stuff. And eventually, I think they will
find a way to extend their application through Starrcade and do some
things like that. But for now, I would say that's the broad
difference. It's really hard to categorise ecosystems with such a
critical categorization. But yeah, that's what I would say.</font></p>

Thanks a lot, Henry. And I guess my last question in terms of
development developer community before we move on to the product is,
I mean, I think you've alluded to it in terms of the composition of
developers. But do you anticipate that this will change given that,
you know, it sounds like the front end of the experience has been,
you know, a lot of very inquisitive, curious people who are intrigued
to test out the possibilities of Cairo. But as kind of more resources
come in? I don't know. Have you kind of seen a change in the

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I
think that, you know, when I started 10 months ago, I remember that
for the first tutorial I wrote, there were some question and when you
when you wouldn't sort of question correctly, you will receive some
ERC 20 token. And there was no way for your smart contract to know
who was calling it, or something like that, or you couldn't through a
way through Voyager through the Explorer, you couldn't really
interact using a wallet like hours, or Bravo's. So I had to add code
in the functions, a parameter where people would specify the wallet
on which they would receive the tokens, which is extremely clumsy, it
worked, but it was really clumsy and not optimal. And so in 10
months, the dev experience has gotten much better, because now it's
something that is much easier to do. And it shows also in the number
of projects who are joining and in the kind of application that are
showing up that the UX is much better. So it's much easier to build
games and mentioned bricks and friends than earlier you can also
mention pixels or results were released something earlier this summer
or start sheet. So it becomes a bit more easy to to experiment with.
With we started, what I expect to happen is that this experience will
get much, much easier in the coming months, especially we have like
the big road for that I think like two big things I see will be that.
Eventually, the starkness stack will move from Python to a faster
language, so rust and so the performances of the network will
increase drastically. So that will make the user experience easier,
because your transaction will go faster, you'll be able to do more
transaction for cheaper stuff like that. And then the other big, the
change will be Cairo going from the first version to Cairo one. And
there isn't a lot of information about Cairo one online yet you can
see a talk by Shaha at certain NCC which is very interesting. But
Kayo, we will get easier to play with. And at that point will get
more and more people it will be much easier to just throw a few lines
of code around and have something working. And eventually, somebody
with all of these people trying out stuff. Somebody is going to
strike gold. Somebody is going to find an application that will have
a big amount of users or a big lot of users. And then we will see a
new wave of developers coming will say oh wow, they there they found
something interesting here let me try to replicate it or to do
something similar in Then we'll get another wave of, of innovative
innovators coming. This may take some time, but that's what I think
will happen.</font></p>

a perfect segue to talk a little bit more about validity, roll ups
and your, your recursive thread, why people get excited about Stark
that. So, so maybe, with that, I will I will just set the stage a
little bit. So Henry, you know, you've you've, you've talked a little
bit about what you've talked a lot about how, why people get excited
about spark that. And there are five main reasons right computation,
account abstraction, trustless, bridging, storage proofs, and fractal
scaling. And that's a lot to go through in this session. But I've
actually had the audience vote on one topic that they're most
interested in, I've also asked you one that you are most excited to

are not like it's not anything scientific. It's not something like a

came up with, like, the, I think, three months ago, when I was trying
to explain why people get excited about Zika roll ups, some of these
things will, I was gonna say some of these things will never emerge.
I'm not sure I think there will be interesting stuff in each of these
fields. But it's not an exhaustive list, there will be other stuff

Cool. So why don't we start with computation. So computation was
something you had mentioned, you're very excited about and, and kind
of you alluded to it earlier about gaming, and then kind of
computation capacity. So maybe what you could do is, you could
explain what it is, or like, why computation on Stark net is
superior. And how, I guess how it differs from the old paradigm?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Henri
 43:13</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
sure. It's the first thing that indeed got me excited about secure
ellipse. So the, the, I think the first realisation I had was a few
years ago, and it was not a good realisation, it was to realise that
if you want a blockchain network like Aetherium, to scale, like, how
do you do currently, in theorem is able to process a good amount of
transaction, but it's not a lot. And when it gets crowded, it gets
very expensive, very fast. And the reason for that is that there's a
limit of gas in the network. Why is there a limit of gas? Well,
because if you want your network to be decentralised, you need to put
a limit on the amount of computations running in node will involve.
And so if you want your node to run on a Raspberry Pi, well, you
can't really ask it to run machine learning models or world
simulations, right? Because your Raspberry Pi will never be able to
catch up with a single one of these. So forget about it if there are
like hundreds of these because it's an open network. And so I
realised that in its current state, it was really hard for a theorem
scale because, like, there's a limit to what you can ask all the
participants of the network and you're kind of limited by Moore's
law, which is pretty cool. But still, it's not that much. And the big
breakthrough, and the reason for that is that if you want a
blockchain network to stay sane, you need all the participants in the
network to have the same vision of the network. mean, what gives
value to Aetherium is that when I send you money, you don't have to
trust me, you don't have to trust the node provider, your node will
take my transaction, analyse it and verify that I have enough funds
and that I was able to pay you. In order for the network to function,
you need to be able to your computer needs to be able to process
everybody's transaction, because there is no other way for you to be
sure to have a common state of the world we all read do the same
work. It's kind of like if we're at a restaurant, and we all agree on
who should pay for his food, but we all pay food different, like,
everybody pays a bid at different times. And at the end of the night,
you say, Okay, now let's run who owns what, to who. And in the
traditional world, you have one person who is doing the with running
the check and saying, okay, Jane owes five euros to NRA. And you need
to trust Him, and usually is a good person, but maybe it's a bad
person, or maybe he did a mistake. So you want to avoid that in the
blockchain world. So you have everybody take everybody's receipts and
running the amount of who owns what to who. Now, if you're five
people, that's fine, you have five receipts, and you have five people
doing computations. If there are 500 people, then each person needs
to go through 500 receipt, it's much longer, it doesn't really scale.
Now, proof of computation. And provable programme allow you to flip
that problem on its head, because now you have a new way to verify
that something is valid. Instead of you having to compute all the
transactions of the network, you can just take a proof that all the
transactions were valid. And it costs you a lot less work to verify
that proof rather than to execute everything at once. So you can have
the same level, you can have the same amount of trust for a given
state without spending as much effort. So if we go back to the
example I took in the restaurant, instead of everybody running 500
receipt, you will have one person running the receipts for everybody.
But instead of having to trust Him, He will give you a you home that
much to an array with a proof, it will take you a bit of work to
verify the proof but you have mathematical guarantee that it did not
cheat, it did not make any mistake. And that's indeed indeed how much
you owe. So this allows either running your network on much smaller
machine, or I think a network that is much more powerful, because now
the computation is done by a single party and just the verification
is done by everybody. It's a bit confusing. I'm not sure if it makes
sense.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">No,
I think it makes a lot of sense. And I guess to summarise just very
quickly, what you said, basically, if I use the receipts analogy,
whoever collects a receipt, might still need a big computation
machine. But in order to check whether those 500 receipts are valid,
you don't longer need to go through each and every single one of them
to reach consensus, because there's actually a proof that validates
all of this without you having to replicate every single one and
checking.</font></p>

 48:07</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Exactly.
And since you have just one person doing the computation for
everyone, maybe he's able to specialise, maybe he's able to run to
bring his own computer and maybe now instead of having 500 people, we
can have 5000 or 50,000. And still everybody knows who they own what
to sell without having to trust anyone's just mathematics.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
I guess my follow up question to that is I guess whoever collects
that receipt right now would be the equivalent of someone like a
sequencer in on Stark net. Are there a lot of barriers to being a
sequencer on stack net given that they do play a big role in in
aggregating and executing these transactions?</font></p>

 48:46</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
right now, I mean, the network is centralised. So we are the
sequencer and there's there's no way you can be a sequencer. But the
plan is to decentralise this in the coming months or year. So and
we'll we're preparing some, we're doing a lot of research around
that. So expect more information around that. But eventually anyone
will be able to be a sequencer. And if when I say anyone is it will
mean anyone willing to probably stake something to get into to get
the right to be the sequencer and anyone willing to put a big machine
and the disposition on the of the network to process as many
transactions as they can. And probably like for example, you will
stake something to get a slot of say an hour of sequencing and you'll
want to maximise your return on investment. So you put as big as
machine as you can to process as many transactions as you can create
a proof for them and collect fees from these transactions. So it's
kind of like like basically it will be what mining is today in proof
of works network is a specialised industry where people make money by
providing a service to the network. but instead of being instead of
the service being security, the service will be execution. So
computing power.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Got
it? Thanks a lot, Henry. And since you said create a proof for them,
are you alluding to the fact that sequencers improvers come hand in
hand? Like if I'm a sequencer I'm also approver? Or can those be
separated?</font></p>

So you're right. It's a good question I made a shortcut sequences and
provers don't have to be the same entities, the sequencer really will
just select who, which transactions will go into a block and then say
to a prover, hey, here's a block, please generate a proof, a proof
for it. And the proof will be published later on to r1. Now, most
likely, sequences and provers will need to allocate big machines and
stake something to get the rights to be a sequencer and approver. So
probably there'll be the same entities and probably if you have if
you're running a sequencer, it might make sense for you to also run a
prover. But it doesn't mean that necessarily, when you have a
sequencing slot, you'll have a prover start like all of this is to be
defined, but you can think of them as two different identities, the
sequencer will select transactions and reach an L to consensus. And
the prover will generate the will generate proof that all the network
executed correctly and publish it to r1.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I'll
just make a nicer a smaller, a smaller party that recently we
mentioned a lot recursion. Once you have recursion, you can have
either the sequencer who will execute your payload, or you can
execute your payload on your computer and then publish it on the
network. And it will be taken as valid because you know, the
computation is valid. For example, say you want to do generative art,
you can either execute this payload on the network and other network
executives and use the output as your your your generative art. Or
you could run it on your own machine, publish the proof according to
the network. And this will cost you less money because you're the
network will just verify the proof. And but it will be as valid as if
the network had run it. Which is really cool. It really means it
really shows that you can use stuff at home and have the network.
Trust it because it's mathematically valid and not because you have
some special privileges. And yeah, anyway, there's a lot of extension
to that. One thing I'm really excited about is privacy obligations
linked to that. Because right now, privacy apps such as, for example,
tornado cash, there's not a lot of them, because privacy is
computation heavy. But once computation is not complete, A is not
very expensive than new, the barrier to like you can do a lot more
stuff. And I'm really excited to see things emerge in that aspect.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
let's, okay, let's cover kind of traction. And then we have time we
can. Sure, sure. So the audience was most interested in actually
learning about account obstruction, and what you mentioned redefining
asset ownership. So maybe to start out, could you tell us what
account abstraction is and how does it actually work on Aetherium
versus dark net?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Henri

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yes,
sure. So, accounting correction, I would define it as the decoupling
into how the node recognise a valid transaction and how the EVM
recognise like manages asset ownership. On Aetherium, you
authenticate yourself towards the network with an EOS. Okay, so
private key the generator with which you can generate a public key
and sign messages. And nodes need to know who is sending the
messages. So transaction in order to check whether the messages are
valid or not. But otherwise, if they would take any message message,
let me take a step back, they need to make sure that the person
sending them a message will pay for this message. Because if you
don't pay for the message, then you can send all sorts of payload
that won't result in in a payment and then it's a dose vector. So
Aetherium uses your public key both to verify that you're sending a
valid transaction and to authenticate who is sending the transaction
and to make this payment and it's really tied to a signature
algorithm. In particular, public key, right? The first thing when
you're broadcasting a transaction, the first thing you know does is
verifying that the transaction is valid. And that there is some money
posted here that so that if the transaction fails, the node will be
compensated for that. A Counter Strike obstruction is basically
making this Verification Mechanism arbitrary, so that anyone can come
up with their authentication design proving that there is something
to pay for the transaction. But it doesn't have to be that specific
signature algorithm. And the way you do that is with a smart
contract, right? Why write some specific code when we have smart
contracts, you can just do that through a smart contract. So all at
their core, even on Aetherium, any transaction will go through a
validate step, and then an execution step. Except for Aetherium. This
validate state step is the same for everyone, it's written in Go and
it's a signature verification, on stack net, that validate function
will be executed by a smart contract, verifying that yes, the
transaction is valid, and this person has the right to spend some
funds. Once this verification is done, it will go to the execute
phase where the payload will actually be executed. And and the
actions are taken on the status of the network and payment will be
done. Now the fact that you can customise this verification section
doesn't seem like much, but in reality, it changes a lot about how
you can interact with the network. Because the first application you
can think of is oh, well, I don't like the current signature
algorithm of Aetherium. Let's use this one, it's newer, it's more
lightweight, so the transaction will be cheaper. Well, that's one
possibility. The other one would be to say, hey, I don't want to use
a single key, I want to use various keys so that we have a native
multi multi SIG. While you could do that also, the other one would be
to say, look, I'm finding a transaction to delegate the voting load
to delegate the signature for a given amount of time to that new
signer. So I'm sending this transaction through this account with my
assets. But I want this new public key to be able to sign for that
same account and manipulate my essence, which would be something
analogous to session keys. Another thing with so having this at the
core level of the protocol makes that every you can making that every
account is a smart contract also allows you things for like, such as
native meta transactions. Which basically, today, if you want to send
a transaction to Aetherium, you need to have ease to pay for gas. And
that's fairly painful. Imagine you're an app and you want to onboard
1000 users, and they have no idea what it is they want to use your
app, but they don't know what it is, then you need to tell them to go
by ease and then put it in their account and then pay for gas. And
that kind of sucks. A lot of people issue a lot of builders, if you
give them the opportunity to pay for the gas for the first few
transactions or the builders, they would do it hands down. But the
problem is, if you do that, then the assets don't really, it's really
hard to have the system be like that and not be custodian not be
custody system, because then your users you manipulate their private
keys.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">With
a count obstruction. Since your users account is not a private key.
It's a smart contract. You can have them sign a payload that allows
them to take some actions. But you broadcast the transaction through
your account contract, you pay fees there, and then the payload is
executed by their contract. And so it allows us to make a much
smoother user experience. Yeah, let's let's stop here for now, unless
you have question, or if it makes sense, it's a bit of a dense topic.
It's hard to explain.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">No,
I think I think it makes a lot of sense. Let's unpack it a little
bit. I think what you mentioned was great, and I just want to
regurgitate a little bit of it, just to make sure that everyone was
able to digest that information. So I guess what you are saying is on
a technical level, you know, obviously there's externally own
accounts on a theory and layer one. But on Stark net, every every
wallet is a smart contract. And there are many ways to kind of
customise the way that your wallet interacts with different
applications. Or just even like how I don't know how people are able
to access your wallet, like things like I don't know recovery, social
recovery session keys, or sorry I'm not summarising was very well but
you know, you can basically mould and shape the way that Your wallet
interacts with the outside world.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
exactly. Let's let's try to summarise it that way, your wallet on
Aetherium today, the only way to manipulate its assets is to sign a
message with a specific private key. And there is no other way you
can enact actions on behalf of your EO a wallet on Aetherium. Smart
started having smart contract wallets meaning that there is no EOS
means that this verification this authentication, you can customise
it and you can put any kind of stuff you want. You can authenticate
yourself with a specific private key, or with values or with one that
changes or whatever logic you imagine it's a smart contract. So you
can just write whatever you want.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Now,
that's great. I think I think that's pretty clear. But I, I guess if
the audience has any questions or follow up questions, account
abstraction, I know there's a lot of material about it put out by
Origin X. But I'm sure that if you have any questions, feel free to
reach out to Henry or even us at Z Kaitlan. And we'll be happy to
answer any questions that you have. I know that is a very dense
topic. Okay, um, is there anything else you want to cover on an
account? Objection, Henry?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">No,
I'll think I'll just end by saying that. I think that account
abstraction will really allow a new wave of UX for for end users to
emerge on Stark net. And UX has been a big issue for Aetherium. And
for the adoption of Aetherium. And I think that you will see systems
that are noncustodial, non trusted, and without, with with a much
smoother and much nicer user experience emerge. Thanks to that, it
will take some time. But it's a really interesting, interesting
frontier to explore. If you're interested in how your users will
interact with the chain. It's not necessarily about the nature of
your app, it's really about the relationship and the usage of your
users on your specific app.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
that's great. And then I completely agree, and I can't wait for the
day, when I guess everyone kind of sees your wallet as a smart
contract. I feel like we're in the middle point right now where,
like, you know, especially on Aetherium, if you have kind of a smart
contract account, like Gnosis safe, it's not actually intuitive to
access a lot of the daps in the space. So I do think there is a
transition that needs to happen. And hopefully, maybe Stark net is
kind of the the network where it all where it all kind of plays out.</font></p>

I mean, contraception is not specific to start net overs, and it's
not specific to Zika rolling, right over networks are trying to
implement it. And it's not an easy feat, either. It's not like
something we just turned on. It's it's something that it's quite
complicated to come up with. So,</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

 1:03:05</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">yeah,
I think one one last thing I want to highlight that I thought was so
powerful when someone said this to me, and I just I feel, I totally
feel it. So I have a, I have a lens protocol account, and it's tied
to my ledger. And what's really annoying about it is, you know, every
time I want to post something, let's just say, I would need to sign
on my ledger. And the idea about accountants traction is, you know,
you're able to actually customise your interaction and the levels of
security that you want to implement. So that, you know, it becomes an
afterthought when you actually want to do something on web three,
rather than making this whole signing thing a very clunky experience.
So as Henry said, I think it will really I agree that it will really
fundamentally change the UX or the user experience for most users and
make user adoption a lot easier Okay, cool. So I we're actually while
we've we've talked for like 15 minutes so maybe I will I will move on
to a wrap up. So Henry, you know you you obviously you work at Stark
where you know the ins and outs with what's going on. I'd love to
hear a little bit more about kind of the stark net roadmap and and
you know what, what is what is up like after Stark net decentralises
You know, there's obviously this document token announcement like
what's next for the network or what's next restart where?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Henri
 1:04:31</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
sure. So I mean, one start, we're starting it is decentralised this
will take a bit of time. This one too, like this is an adventure in
and of itself. And nobody's really done this before. When you think
about it, networks were used widely today started decentralised,
right Bitcoin Aetherium they all started decentralised, taking a
centralised network and decentralising it is like, like nothing comes
to mind that manage To do that, that's a big challenge. And we're
getting just getting started with it, I'm confident we'll do it. But
it's, it will be like this will be a big, big adventure in and of
itself. The second thing to watch out I think for will be Cairo one,
we have some content coming out soon about it and it will make
basically, it will give you both features for depth, the language
will be easier to use, and you'll be able to do more stuff. And it
will be give you nice features for Stark net and for the
decentralisation of the network. Also, like for example, today, you
don't have the concept of an invalid transaction for Stark net, or
let's say does differently, you don't have the concept of fail that
transaction transaction that was executed, did not work correctly.
But you were charged for this, if you send a bad transaction is just
not executed. But it's a das vector attack, right. Cairo one will
include some things, something called SEER that will give us these
kind of concepts, these things will be a big game changer, but for
the network and for the dev experience. And associated to that I
think performances will increase drastically. And right now you see a
lot of activity on stack net that is still fairly slow and fairly
new. I think we will, in the medium term get to a point where the
network really is blazingly fast and much cheaper than the
alternative. So I think that's like these are the most Ntaganda
network level. These are the things I'm mostly waiting.</font></p>

trying to think about something funny, but now I just want to say
thank you for having me. I really don't feel like I deserve to have
the spotlight on me. But thank you. Thanks for letting me talk a bit
about what we do. Yeah, just want to say if anyone in the audience is
curious about trying stuff on Stark net, don't hesitate and ask
questions. I think like, one of the main assets you can have as a dev
today is to be building stuff, trying stuff and asking questions. And
asking question is a really important part of it. Because when you're
exploring new stuff, not everything is documented, not everything is
written. And it's really worth reaching out to, to people and say,
Hey, how does this work, and it doesn't have to be us. It doesn't
have to be me. It doesn't have to be stark where it can be. But it
can be also just fellow builders just engaged with people because at
the end of the day, Blockchain networks are networks of people,
individuals, and what will make these network grow? Is the people
building on it, and people using it. And this starts with talking
with one another.</font></p>

thank you to the audience for listening in. I know that we've run a
little bit over time, but hopefully you learned something about, you
know, account, Objection, or computation or even just a little bit
more about Henry. And, you know, with with our ama series, you know,
we usually end with a poll app. So for for today, if you're
interested in then take a poll app, the secret word is stark struck.
So it's all in small caps, and it's S T A, R k, s, t. R. U. C. K. so
stark struck. It's the name of Henry's podcast, and I thought it
would be a nice homage. I don't know if that's the way you say it.
But it's a nice dedication to Henry and for all the work that he's
done for the stock net ecosystem. So thank you everyone, for
listening in. And stay tuned for our next episode. Thank you. Bye.
