if you wish we can start how we meet each other and how we got into
crypto. So me and your man and some of our teammates, were all we
were all in the same university. So we had a university club called
Blue chain boss University, Blockchain blockchain club. So, and
Yamana also have founded this University Club blockchain University
Club. So my story of crypto have started with this club. And also,
how I met my co founders, and my precious teammates was thanks to the
is precious club watching. So that's, it's how we got to know each
other and how we got into the crypto for real brief.</font></p>

nice, nice. Thank you guys for this short briefing about you. So how
did you come up with the idea of early Starkers and what? You know,
what was the path until your until you started building?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yes.
So firstly, our Starkers projects is inspired by the famous Hollywood
Walk of Fame. It's basically a road on which there are some stars and
on the stars. The names of the celebrities are written. I'm pretty
sure most of you guys know that but just wanted to make an
explanation about it. So our project was totally inspired partly by
that the first time you We were just planning to make it as a fun
project. Actually, it wasn't even like him projecting, but just an
idea, but then we decided to make a fun project, maybe that could be
a good memory for people who could write their names on stars. But we
suddenly discovered that if you do this, on a Niblett known chain,
like sarpnet, we will actually be gathering all the early adopters
and the pioneers of the community. So we wondered what would happen
if we collect all of these people and put them in a cop like
platform. So to to discover the results, we have continued to project
but I should tell that the project has really evolved from a fun
project into something real precious that we give care. So also, and
maybe I can explain why soapnuts like, we had to make a choice for
the chain for the bulk of the coffin. So we thought the stock market
and the stock concept was harmonic. So that was our choice.</font></p>

 16:17  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">All
right. Nice. Nice. So to break it down a bit. Okay. You have
announced, of course, a collaboration with stack NET projects. So
among these projects, we are to one of these. And we're very glad
about that. So, you announced that the early Starkers holders receive
a dot start domain okay. What are these domains for what is what is
the value what is the the use case behind the this facilitation?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Early
Starkers  17:00  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So,
okay, before that, I guess I should tell the importance of domains.
So in native Ethereum or sarpnet, as you know, we use addresses which
are not really human readable. So domains help us making these
addresses the transaction infos, the sender and the owner more human
readable, readable, and it makes the user experience far more better
and human readable. So the thing that makes these domains critical is
the user experience, it increases the quality of the usage of
blockchain in our daily life. So that's the first thing. And as we
think our community is a group of highly valued people, as their
early adopters, and pioneers of the stagnant community, which also
means that these people are the ones that can that have the highest
potential of creating value and contribute to contributing to the
ecosystem, we thought that we had to, let's say, create a label and
reward our stakeholders our users. So, what we had come up was the
idea of using domains airdropping term domains, which also is
harmonic with our project. So, the domains that will that we will
AirDrop in the future are like to give an example if your horse
holding fifth star you will get fifth zero 0/5 dot star. So, this
will be the domain that will be drops. And if I took elebrate the
domain like we have investigated the start net ecosystem, like who
makes these domains who provides the domains and we came up with
Stark net ID. So we are restores and thanks to our partnership, we
have been able to airdrop people domains worth of $106 for free.</font></p>

Speaker  19:15  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">By
the way, I will try to add that in that part. These four digit
domains are known as a premium domains in the domains domain. So in
these domains costs 30 Cheerio in secondary sales in in terms of the
Atari name services. So for digital coins is a very premium thing and
a very good opportunity for domainers sellers. And we want to take
this privilege to stockholders in the first step. Our stockholders
receive free AirDrop which costs these domains In $160, in a Thai
Name Service is totally free for that.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
okay, that's interesting. So, you have all you have already
evaluation regarding these domains, yes,</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">actually,
the current price is not public yet, in start to tie down starting
that domain service is constituting a price. But it will be I think
more high the other domains because they are four digits. But no more
for the if your store store order, you will receive them freely. But
we will, I want to add that, we will make a snapshot in random time,
and he dropped us domains in the current store old is not enough.
When the snapshot taken, we will AirDrop according Tam, also we are
waiting for the main net reset, because dark net is going to main net
reset currently, maybe Matt wants to add something on that. But I
want to say that start net domains will be start the service after
the main net reset. So we are waiting for done after the main net
reset, we will continue to distribute all the stars</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
to make things easier and simpler. We'll wait for airdropping
domains, at least until the main main net state resets. So like we
don't say we will take the snapshot before or after the reset, but we
will definitely drop them off to the resets.</font></p>

okay, maybe I can tell you a little bit about our roadmap. And before
that maybe I can tell you what we have done so far. So currently,
people can see their thoughts in our storyboards. So these people
that are in storyboard in the in the course time, soon, we will be
opening our private discord. Currently, we are working hard to create
to complete the structure of discord. And soon after opening the
private discord for the star holders, we will enable our naming
feature. What this means is that people will be permanently write
their names on their source on chain, and everyone in certain echo
system will be able to come to our website and see who's who are
these great people, the early adopters pioneers, these people will
have the chance to create a great memory and tell other people their
project names or their names. So this will be the first step. Another
thing on our roadmap, and that makes me really excited is our
service. Like, let me explain you the Star Wars. Actually Star Wars
is like a customer's profile page specific for our SAR holders, in
which people will be able to share their social media links, their
project links or their personal links that they want to inform their
followers regarding stagnant ecosystem. So this will be valuable as
people will have the chance to share what they do, they are updates
on their projects on or on their personal career path career paths on
stack net. So newcomers to the ecosystem will have an really easy way
to get into the ecosystem. Search for the projects and what these
early adopters and pioneers have done so far to get inspired or to
get deep knowledge in what's going on in the ecosystem. So like you
can consider it as an board aprt blockholder sharing his personal
engagements in projects, what they follow what they try to do in the
space, so I guess it will be vulnerable. And another cool feature
that we will open soon, soon after Star wall which will also backup
and support our galactic wall is our crypto tutu like At platform, we
have what we call galactic talk. So in this platform, people just
like Twitter will be able to make daily announcements updates
regarding their projects. So it will be even easier for newcomers and
other peoples that want to get inspired or informed about their
projects from these great people that try to create value and
contribute to the ecosystem. So these are the main things on our
roadmap.</font></p>

want to clarify one thing in addition, something in the galactic
talk, you can constitute it's like activity, but only stockholders
can tweet it. This is short proof of the last milestone of our
roadmap, but the current last milestone because we are growing day by
day, and we are making any videos for the stockholders. We are
working so hard, and maybe it's not the last thing, but it's the
current last development thing for us currently.</font></p>

it's an NFT, which indicates that you will hear in the meeting, and

as you all know, sarpnet is a growing chain, but it's really an early
stage like in terms of development. So regarding development,
environment and programming language that right, the contracts,
called Cairo has, like many missing features and like it's really
natural, we can understand it, it's still really an early stage for
the chain. So the language gets frequently updated. And like in in
the near past, the language has had the big update. Also there,
really a lot of updates coming to the tools for the developers opens
up on libraries, like all of them are still updating and getting
improved. They are still in their development process. Like because
this is the main reason why I started it is in its alpha main net. So
writing the contracts and creating, like the development process was
really challenging for us as because of this early stage thing, there
are really like handful of resources that we can follow up. So at
this point, I should really feel like I must think to start with our
team, especially Lee, Henry Lucas and Lucas and, Dr. Spaceman because
they really helped us a lot during our journey, especially in
Dortmund, also, they helped us about other topics, but Dortmund was
really challenging. Like there are little or no resources about
specific things. Like maybe it's the correct point to mention that we
had to create a new library for what is think we are Merkle trees,
like it was the first project that used what is with Merkel tree in
the let's say start next. So like we had to create a new library new
js file for this. And maybe it will be a bit too technical, but I
feel like I should mention that, like uttering uses Kazakh 256. But
Signet has a completely different hashing system. So like we couldn't
just copy and paste the Ethereum Merkle tree library from opens up
like we had to write most of the things by ourselves like, and</font></p>

on chain link. Also, it was the first project on chain name your NFT.
Yeah, by the way, we also URL in the NF T's. For example, one of the
Another inspiration from this project is the moon Cat Rescue. I was
meant to the moon kit, and it's very fun project. I think it's two
years before that. And when you rescue and actually find that moon
cat, you can name it, it was a very good meeting. And I want to
inspire I want to use this experience in that project. So we need to
a whole new concept and a whole new code for this naming process. And
so this is the first project instruct net in terms of the whitelist
project. And in terms of naming in terms of first project launched in
Minsk, we really talk talk so much of it Minsker, because we need
some requests, we need some updates for that and they respond our
needs. They update the website, add new features for specifically for
us. And I think very cool thing and very fun because we start to met
lots of people. We know so much people in stock that currently we
nearly every day we talked with the arbiter finance, they increase
the limits for the transfers, because our meeting price is the upper
than their transfer limit. So we request them to get increased the
limits and they will also increase the limits. And they will also

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">In
terms of the making NFT project, I think it's a very hard thing
because of the biases of the people. We are so before in the nfts
it's our near first and empty project in terms of community project.
So we want to make a good very good product we want to make a good
reputation. We really analyse the old expectations we really listen
to everyone. We are nearly all of the discourse groups in start met
with anonymity in terms of Anonymous was so we know who is thinking
about the project and we are always listed on the community and make
a better product but we are also of trusting our idea and product.
So, we will make this project as, as we can. So we, for example, we
didn't this project Freeman, because we think Freeman projects is a
company that is harmful for the communities SVR community project, we
need to good filter for the finding the right person at this price,
and we believe that our holders just earn so much in terms of
trusting us.</font></p>

responsibility is very professional from your side. But I think from
as long as the little time that I spent with you and getting to know
you, I think you're doing a great job, and you will succeed in the,
in this journey. And since you since you mentioned, you know, all the
challenges around building on stack net, it's a good idea, you know,
to have a joint conversation between all the projects that we're
building on stack net, and then share, you know, ideas and feedbacks.
And I would ask you for, if you were to choose any specific piece of

it's like, let, let me start with the technical side. So if anyone
wants to build something, on Main net currency on stripe net, there
is a big challenge that they have to face, which is the state resets.
So it's a bit frustrating, and frightening at first, like, all of the
data will be gone. So how we will restore all the data and make these
tokens get not lost. This was like, a bit, as I said, frustrating for
us. So like the developers, or anyone that currently wants to make a
project on sarpnet may not alpha should really carefully plan how to
migrate the tokens after the state. So we really had to make a VM
really had to spend a lot of time on brainstorming on how we cannot
like we shouldn't skip any details on the migrating part after the
state. So one thing that people should really be careful and double
check is the reset part. So I will, in terms of the technical side
suggests they want to take care of that and be really careful with
that, because it's something really serious. And so another thing
that we can say he's that, like various one NFT project, and
currently in the, in the space, there are a lot of bias against NFT
projects, like people consider their people or create threads
starting to create a strict stereotype. Like it's a bit normal, I can
understand people there have been many rockpools Minister camp
projects, but like introducing, informing the community
transparently, step by step, like currently we are in which step off
the project, the last updates and the progress about the project.
Giving all this stuff to the community transparently makes them feel
more secure. So you can create a more let's say trustful environment,
as, as I said, there's because of this biassed NFT environment,
people's perspective against NFT product. So that's another thing
that NFT projects can take care of. Because like we want NFC projects
to improve themselves. And because we we believe in the future of NF
T's they will be much more valuable in the future in terms of the
utilities they provide and the things that they enable us to do. So
we want more we want to see more NFT products, what more high quality
products but many people that really want to create value and make
high quality things are scared of displaced environment. So I want to
ask them to be more encouraged. And as I said, do the steps to run
from this get away from this environment and create a trustful
environment?</font></p>

totally agree with you totally agree. And adding adding to that
point? Yes. You know, the use case is behind the NFT. The NF T's are,
you know, almost limitless. I NFT is technology and I think we we
need more than a few projects like you which showcase another use
case, besides you know, the pixels and selling God. stuff. So, that's
a very good thing that you are helping the audience and people who
are interested in NF Ts, to realise that there's a lot more to the
NFT world than, you know, only the artistic side. So yes, and what,
what's next for the Starkers? Do you have any news or you want to
share with us some feedback, some statistical feedback that, you
know, you want to showcase.</font></p>

as I said, our, in our roadmap, we are currently opening to discord
first at the naming, briefly and this terrible antibiotic talks. And
between those of termites that, like were promised, and we will do
the with stagnant ID, the stagnate domain source drop domain drop.
Currently, actually, we want to reward Furthermore, our community,
our stakeholders, and create them privileges in this tight knit
community. So we're really working hard for making some surprises for
them. But like before making anything certain it wouldn't be correct
or ethical to make an announcement before making an agreement. But I
should definitely say that, like our committee, or stakeholders
should really get excited for the upcoming news because we're really
working hard for that. Like we don't, I personally don't find it to
to give promises before making things certain. But we're really
working hard to make some good stuff and given proposal privileges on
site x.</font></p>

cool community in that place. And we are slowing our process because
of the we want to eliminate all the parents because and also all the
free metres. We are looking for the good community we could that's
why we got vi related squat. Currently we are collaborating with
pixels for squat integration recently, they will do some new feature.
If you if you ever started NFT you can connect your discord. Thanks,
Tom. They are really good at producing and developing for the
ecosystem not for money. So everything is ready for this god month we
are waiting for to some papers get eliminate. And after that I think
our stars is more valuable than now.</font></p>
