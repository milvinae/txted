I think that we can start so thank you for everyone for joining us
today. So this is our second episode of defined podcast presented by
gamma x. So define is aim to be the ultimate crypto guide for trading
defy and emerging crypto projects. So this is our series stock
defined where we're introducing you to hot stock where ecosystem
projects and explore how this projects can make your life easier. Um,
my name is Lucy and I'm the head of community here at Chemex. And for
those who don't know already gamex is Orderbook based decentralised
derivative exchange with an on chain transaction settlement layer and
an off chain order book and matching engine to give you the best user
experience. And we are on Ethereum. We're compatible with Ethereum to
have a low cost and partner with stock were to build on their layer
two scaling solution stock X. And today with me, I have some team
member and the founder of ash stack DNA and Eris, sorry if I
mispronounce your name, it's like that. And they are going to tell us
more about their journey to start where ecosystem and the specific
approach they have to solve one of the fires biggest issue under
collateral is lending. So hi, both of you. Thank you for joining me
today. It's great to have you. Why don't we start off by introducing
yourself and let people know about your background and how did you
get into crypto</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Hello.
Hello, see? Thank you for having us. Hi, guys. My name is Luna. I'm
the founder of hashtag. Through hashtag, we facilitate secure under
collateralized loans for the crypto retail users. We have been in the
r&amp;d for about three or four months now. And we have an active
tenant on the chain. And we'll be releasing the test net on target in
the next couple of weeks. A brief background about me, I come with
about nine plus years experience building consumer technology
products. For the last seven years, I've been focused, I've been
focusing in the blockchain and fintech spaces. So prior to hashtag, I
worked the product head at the new banking startup based on
Bangalore, they had an opportunity to work with the savings and
credit products. Now, while working on the credit product at this
particular company, I came across the Oh collateralization problem in
defy, but it was not until the defection of one did I have my
validation that hey, if I could actually is actually more accept
being accepted in comparison to the new branch, which continued to
struggle with a strong value proposition. So the validation and
return of this problem of choice, I left my job and I wanted to solve
this problem. So I spent about 10 plus months trying to figure out a
solution for this problem could because there are many products out
there who are trying to facilitate under collateralized or
uncollateralized loans, but their approach is rather myopic. They
want to have implement some form of origin credit is correctly
simplified put credit scores on the credit score on the blockchain,
which is not practical today. Because less than point one 6% of the
global population is on crypto and even within them less than 5% of
crypto wallets have adequate auction data to</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
Lucy, good day again, from my side. I am Maris I'm working in Cass
tech for over one year now as a dev real growth and community
associate my affiliation with crypto goes back to 2017. Around early
of the year. So I've been following quite, you know, constantly, the
whole space. And in the last couple of years. I deep dive a bit
further. So I started you know, searching for fundamentals and going
over all the technologies that are going to disrupt a sector. And of
course, that was the reason that I I bumped into hashtag and they saw
great potential in what Vinnie was building. So when I hit the nail
for for the job, I could not resist. And, of course I jumped in. And
it's been a great journey until now. Many challenges, and I'm sure
many more will, will come in the way but we have gained very good
traction. And we are very optimistic about our project. It will. It's
being built robust and with a safety as a number one priority. And of
course, our our switch to the K native and especially joining for us
to join the stock medical system is something which is very
thrilling. And because we strongly believe the whole ecosystem is
going to be a massive massive success and it's going to be you know
the next big thing in crypto</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">yeah
Absolutely. And so in, like, the process of building ash stack, when
you were doing research on the Corrado is lendio protocol, like what
are the unique problem that you see that other projects were not
tackling on?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Vinay
| Hashstack  10:23  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">All
right. So of show algebra guy, I'd like to see any product that's
consumer facing must answer the VI, for all its system participants,
in order to be long term sustainable. If we look at a defy lending
product in general, there are three critical system participants, the
lender, borrower and the protocol itself. All our direct competitors
today assume that assume the need to compromise the borrower's
experience to achieve protocol security. Therefore, they ended up
with the old collateralization approach of seeking excess collateral
against the loan, this serve nice use cases. So an average crypto
digital user wouldn't use a compound or maybe RF or flashcards, but
compound or make it out in general, because it just does not make
sense from a fundamental utility point of view. And this, in effect,
creates adoption created adoption, friction for the existing players.
So in effect, the problem you're trying to solve otherwise
established, we're trying to call the over collateralization problem
in the felony. And in this process, we have, we've actually put
ourselves in the shoes of our competitors as to what were the Theses
as to going with the old collateralization approach. And we wanted to
figure out if there's something we can do to enable to facilitate
more loan frequencies of collateral dollar. So again, this was a
basic brainstorming that went by in the process that led to the
product we have today. Does this answer your question? If you have a
specific question adapter, chicken?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">GammaX
Exchange  12:16  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yes,
it does. So before us to more about like one of the problems with
under collateralized loan and why is it so difficult indeed, sight?
Unseen, you explain to a listener, what exactly are under
collateralized loan in a simple term.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Vinay
| Hashstack  12:34  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">In
simpler terms, under collateralized loans, or other cherish you read
in the borrower provides less security against the loan they acquire.
So let's say I want to borrow $100. And if I go to a lender, and if
the lender asked me one $50, as a security, so that their loan can be
secured in the event of default, then in this particular example, I'm
providing one $50 security that is collateral to acquire a $100 loan,
this particular transaction is over collateralization, where the
collateral exceeds that offload, which every other marketplace today
does. Now, under collateralization, on the other hand, involves the
scenario building, I have a good credit score, I have a stable
income. So a bank, I go to bank, and the bank gives me $110,000 loan
for as a personal loan, just based on my credit score, and it does
not it may or may not ask for any collateral. So in the event, the
bank has a collateral, and usually the collateral will be less than
the loan I'm trying to acquire, because of my good credit score and
the financial stability. That would be a case of under
collateralization. For example, maybe we'll do a quick $10,000 loan
from the bank. But I may have to show the security of let's say
$2,000 worth of physical assets. So here the collateral is less than
the loan I'm trying to acquire the credit card which we see today,
they are uncollateralized loans wherein the bank gets your credit
line when you have a card that allows you to spend up to $5,000 or
$10,000 a month that needs to be repaid within 2030 days into the
next month. But this credit line you get if not backed by any
collateral in the sense the bank does not ask you to provide any
collateral upfront. So this particular form of lending is called as
uncollateralized. So simply put under collateralized lending is a
scenario where as a borrower, you can borrow more loan with less
collateral.</font></p>

Exchange  14:50  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Thank
you for the example as an explanation I think that makes it easier
for everyone to understand it. So when it comes to under
collateralized loan there are obvious see higher risk? Like how do
you assess in the sign like credit worthiness of borrowers and
protect yourself from default? Can you hear me?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Vinay
| Hashstack  15:19  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
so that's a fair question. And right now as we have established,
crypto is just beginning to see mainstream adoption and we have
already entered the new bear cycle. So I believe we are at least two
to four good years away from a significant mainstream adoption in
terms of byte now less than 3.9% of the global population is into
crypto. So, this should give you a precedent that the origin activity
is also restricted. So to determine a user's credit worthiness, we
have to stitch various data points that are fragmented both on chain
and on often resources such as the user's activity with the
centralised financial product could be centralised exchanges, etc, to
determine the credit worthiness from the financial activity
standpoint, but on a holistic level KPIs for KYC and social graph of
the user will also come into picture down the line. Now, at this
point, how we are balancing the risk is the art system is designed in
a way that it is agnostic of the user's credit worthiness in the
sense, just to give a simple example, through open a user can borrow
up to $300 with a collateral as little as one and $1. Now, the $300
loan they acquired, they can spend it use it as a trading capital or
they can split it into trading capital as as well as a personal cash
requirement. So for the portion of the loan, that is up to $70, they
can withdraw into the wallet, while the balance $230 is within the
protocol. So in effect, the protocol always secures itself by
ensuring it has a significant control over the loan that is given to
the borrower. Now here, the relationship between the protocol
borrower and the loan is such that the protocol owns the loan, in the
sense of the protocol owns the loan that is given to the user in its
wallet, but the borrower has the right to spend, and the borrower can
spend this loan across applications that we integrate, which we
carefully curate. And if the borrower ends up making profits in the
process, to trade through sticking etc, it is for the borrowers to
keep. And if the borrower ends up making loss, then if the loan inter
becomes distressed, that's when the liquidation process kicks in. So
in effect, the fact that by designing while enabling under
collateralized loan, they have also designed the system where the
protocol is never in negative in terms of the effective negative
capital, it secured itself in the in adverse conditions. So this is a
mathematical way of approaching to risk. But on a process level, we
do use competition feeds the partner with empiric we use competition
feeds to determine the underlying volatility of an asset that allows
us to determine the permissible LTV that needs to be given to a
borrower at the time of new laundry, etc.</font></p>

So, they have integrated Alright, so we have integrated one of the
renowned automated market maker, think of it as uniswap on the
Darknet which allows you to strap the loan your car into another
coins. The are currently integrating a decentralised Exchange, which
allows you to trade assets. That's product number two. We are also
working with a couple of other different applique Should we add in,
we can enable staking opportunities for you. So these are the
preliminary products we are integrating as of now. And down the line
depending on the traction and depending on our community governance,
we'll be able to scale into different domain Shadwell, such as game

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">certainly,
so what we do is we identify and integrate, what we do is we identify
and integrate dabs that fit on a broader level that fit about seven
criteria. Those gaps must have real utility, not just traction, the
developers must be accessible and the code must be accessible. Solid
development practices, if the product is audited, it's a bonus. If
they have a bounty programme, it's even its bonus. So often, at
times, what happens is considering the free and open source nature of
most of the defy projects, we do not really need to enter into a
formal agreement, in most instances, because the contract code is
easily accessible. So we do our own internal technical proof of
concept. And once we have a certainty that, hey, we can integrate the
systems and the developers are accessible. And the other factors are
talked about, then, based on the long term goals of both the
production and for entering into a formal partnership I thought</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
so I have been working on this problem for about 34 months, full time
for the last two plus years. For the first 1012 months, I've been
focused purely on the problem discovery and market study. Right now
we have a decent team, we are 20 plus people full time, a couple of
more people joining this month, so hence the plaster. Our engineering
team is on site based out of Bangalore. Now the biggest problem we
have faced is there are two problems actually, we face the primary
being acquiring the right talent into the team. And the second
problem being the constant change of market dynamics. So we were on
BNB chain. And then we had ongoing discussions with polygon, and
Stockwell. We have partnered with polygon and stuck with just like
you guys have done. But polygon z k VM has was pushed to q4 this
year, and stuck with her they had, you know, a product had tools and
environment that were ready, that enable any product to be deployed
to them. So we did some validation, and it cost us about 60 days to
do the validation to upskill our developers. So now we have we have
literally literally rebuild a product from scratch on startup. Now,
tomorrow, if another elven comes in, and as the narrative goes with

think they think Elmo is going to be the main reason on which a wide
range of people are going to use crypto in the coming future and we
want to be the leader in this space. And if you see loans from our
traditional sense in traditional finance, it's never really over
collateralized. And it's a lot more loans, majority people take
personal loans and where you know, the collateral is very minimal.
So, we think for the majority people to start using Blockchain based
lending borrowing under collateralized has to be the way and and
Ultras are going to be the answer for low gas transactions. So, I
think stop net is right kind of mixture for fun to place ourselves in
this ecosystem and build on top of it to answer the question</font></p>

different technology, the language which is Cairo there, and from
there, the learning might be a little steeper compared to someone
from solidity background, but I title does what it does for the
purposes of Rolex essentially tries to anything that that happens on
the on the blockchain ensures that there is a proof of computation
that that can be proved once the transactions are sent to the Elven.
So good land is to pick up to build on these systems. Going ahead,
it's not very difficult as well. Someone from Python background

so I wanted to talk about the early stage of our stack. And
basically, like, I wanted to know, what are the most interesting

learning has been tremendous. Because, again, when you build a when
you build a project, it's not just a product, but it's also a number
of things that you must factor in, you make mistakes you learn along
in the process. So they have a lot of learning to be thrown. In terms
of things I would do differently. Obviously, last week in the bull
market, show that you know, we could have read some reports in the
process. But again, the market is building so no complex on that
regard.</font></p>

updates. And the basic one is definitely we'll be releasing this

that, we have some updates with regards to the next two major
