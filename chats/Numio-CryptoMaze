on things that are relevant to us. So things like, for example,
account creation, onboarding kind of identity, we're seeing a couple
new protocols, everyone is trying to create this identity reputation
layer. So we're monitoring of these. Besides that, we're just
educating our community how to use the casing to use how to bridge
the lead to doing some webinars within the community. But yeah, and
we're waiting for to see how the merge will go. And of course, there

listen. Welcome. And if this is your first LTE On Air thank you for
joining. My name is Mark Anstead. I'm one of the cofounders of
Noumea, which is a noncustodial mobile wallet on Aetherium. So you
can buy sell trade invest into crypto, but our primary focus is
giving you the best user experience on Aetherium and primarily
Aetherium layer tubes, which is why we are having this interesting
discussion today with the crypto mais team, which is building out a
product on top of z k sync. If you don't know what Z k sync is, it is
a layer to z k roll up. So first, before we get into I guess what
crypto maze is if you guys want to jump in, we have two of their team
members here with us. Please jump in and give a quick little

Thanks for having us. Hello, guys and girls. I'm Alex Alex Evans, the
CEO of crypto maze. I've been around in the space for like 456 years,
about is 2016 17. I don't know. And started building communities back
in the day went into research, dive deep into defy health plan some
protocols with friends, what some white papers. And basically last
year, I saw that technology is kind of ready, because I always wanted
to create a project that has a big impact, like not as small but
like, be impact. So I look into the gaming and they scour for neddie
I was looking for concepts that are already in the works. So that's
how I find Maddie and his team and dedicated. Share the rest of the
story.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
sure. Thank you for having us. So about the story, we have been
making keep the mess for some time now we need to sit at it to be on
web two. And we had the basic concept ready and a lot lower quality
than we have right now. And it was almost ready to be released with a
lot less content than the current idea. And the team. Together with
with me.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Everybody,
the code team has more than 10 years of experience in what they're
doing. Me personally, I have been a developer for the past 1011
years. And I went into the Indie gaming business around five or six
years ago. And I created one, not one but multiple windy titles, and
one of them was a little bit more outstanding than the other ones and
had like, around 250k downloads, I think in Google Play is the
current number now. And the other team members are obese in
technological aspect in designing aspects. And the other team, they
are the members of the team. I don't know how much people we are
currently. But we are growing more and more. That's a quick
introduction.</font></p>

Thank you. And so now, without further ado, would you love to I would
love if you could tell us a little bit more about what crypto maze is
sort of what your goal is. And I guess like the vision of what you're
building, because I know you guys have been building for quite some
time and would love to hear more about sort of what it really is that
you all are building.</font></p>

 </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
thanks. So crypto maze will it started was very, very normal, free to
play game on web two. But what is becoming is kind of a big deal, in
my opinion, because web two is is already dying. And the by by the
numbers and by the possibilities that we have in web three. The
titles that are building, like in stealth will just wipe off just
everything in web two. So what crypto Mace is currently, there are
two components to it. One is our main product, which is the crypto
maze game. It's a free to play web three game. And it's like mobile
focused, where users can basically gather with friends from 50 to 100
people and it's kind of a mix between Battle Royale and MMO RPG. And
the whole concept of the game loop is these big labyrinth the mazes
some of you might have seen Are you can get as a guild as a free
member, and you race to the finish to find the boss in the maze. So
there's PvP and PvE. Very fun game loop. But that's part of the
components of crypto maze. The other is around the crypto maze being
a platform for others to create games and virtual experiences, which
you'll come a bit later. But nonetheless, it's very important part of
the user. Call it Metaverse call it web three, whatever, where
basically, the network and the company, everything from the revenue
to the voting is shared with the community, the players, the content
creators, the creators of new assets in order to achieve this very
open and out with the light incentive ecosystem. So yeah. Awesome,
thank</font></p>

 </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">you
for that. And I know, one of the things that kind of brought you guys
a lot of headlines very recently, was this, I guess, NFT drop that
you did for some of your in game characters, which are called crypto
mites. And I guess how are those characters or NF TS planned to be
used in your ecosystem? Because that was known as the I guess a quote
unquote, it was called the Genesis drop. Is that correct? And then I
guess, what are they and how are they able to be used?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

 </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yes,
so the Genesis drop have a lot of utility, mainly, they are heroes,
which are playable in game. So they have different stats, different
gaming elements. In open sea, we have a very loud system where they
have might, they have certain power mobility, and other stuff, which
are actually in games that's also together with that hero, they also
got an item box. And we have actually two elements, which which are
two collections, which if anybody means that out this genetic
collection, they got to unrevealed NF T's, they can review them
whenever they want. And when they review them, they get the hero
collection, they get one hero with the stats that I just said about
in the other one is items. When you open a box, loot box, you get one
to four NFT items, which will be usable in game, and each of them has
different stats again, and there will be only minted now and never
dropped in the game afterwards. This is one of the elements, Alex can
go into more detail about the not in game, the game termites.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

 </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">So
because we are aiming to create not just a casual game, but one with
deep lore and story, the mysticism around the crypto mites, we want
to keep it for now we all know that these are some beings that are
travelling between space and time. So they're a bit confused and
they're looking to find the secret for their where they come from
within these giant mazes. Another cool utility of the crypto mites is
that holding one will unlock a lot of free, free stuff for the people
in terms of free land plot, possibly, and hearing there will be a
token there are some big exchanges who want to lease the tokens. So
the holders of the Genesis will similar to the birthdate so having
been having a lot of fun. But again, these are the main characters,
which will be used in this title. And they will be you'll be able to
use them in other titles as well. And they also play a role for the
community. Basically, when you hold one you're inside our club where
we share Alpha Leisha different stuff, so it becomes kind of a
family.</font></p>

 </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Very
cool. And I guess, as these crypto mites are going to be, I guess
used in the game. Or I guess as you plan to release it. I guess a
like what are some of the steps required for you to get to that
point? And when will we potentially be able to expect some version of
the game had to be released. I know I've seen a lot of, I've seen a
lot of cuts about or videos of what the in game functionality will
look like and what the, I guess the world will look like. So when you
think that that's something that I guess some of your users or
community might be able to expect.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">So
that would be the demo data VP, which is kind of two months around in
two months. And we're looking to open it up not only to the holders
of the community, but also to some key strategic partners, because
like, we're doing a lot of these deaf at the moment behind the
scenes, and everybody's keen to actually test it out to check the
game loop. Because it's obvious that one of these kind of gaming
metal versus who cares like really, really engaging game loop will be
become just huge. So in about two months, we will drop a little demo,
like not a call vertical slice, because to be honest, the competition
is getting pretty, pretty big. So we are keeping a lot of things
behind since I don't want to open eyes of the competitors. But I'm
pretty happy to show what we're building. And just to mention our
about the game. People the regular user won't needs to hear for
crypto might, because we are doing one of the kind of biggest
airdrops in the world. Because technically, previous games have
nearly have, like, couple 100,000 people, but like, what we're
building now will be in the millions. So all the free to play, people
will receive a free NFT crypto might as they create the account and
download the game, which is kind of a very, very smooth and easy
onboarding, like we want, basically are NFT for free, he assured so
they can start levelling up. So we're not restricting users won't
have to know anything about crypto to play the game. But again, back
to your questions. In about two months, we, of course, we are trying
to time things in crypto, you know, we don't have the luxury of like
of the traditional triple A titles who have like two, three years,
just to build quietly, we have to release in strategic times in
crypto because part is the gaming side. That part is the investment
side will love to see some some more. How can I say traffic around
the z k sync 2.0 main net and the ecosystem around? So maybe we'll do
kind of a big event live with some popular people, but to see how
things go.</font></p>

That's super exciting. I know. We're all very much looking forward to
to that going live. So I guess one of the things that I'm kind of
curious about so I, I'm a big gamer myself, I've been playing video
games pretty much since I I grew up. I play on Xbox primarily. And
one of the games that I started playing recently is a game called
foul guys. And one of the things that kind of caught my eye is I
don't want to say they're like blob like characters. But some of the
characters looked sort of familiar with crypto maze and is like the
concept of, I guess, like the maze aspect, similar to what you're
doing with what fall guys is doing. And then I guess adding in a
layer of, I guess, adventure and battling monsters or bosses. Yeah, I
guess that's something that I'm kind of curious about. Yeah, that's,</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">that's
a good overview, because we actually got inspired by four guys a lot.
We love the physics of their game. They have been building something
amazing. And they also do like a full year battle with our game. And
they're actually exactly on point on how it should be done. It's done
in Unreal Engine. And we have been closely looking at them and the
heroes are very unique and they're going to be a lot different. But
we love the physics in four guys. So we would like to Make something
that is similar but a lot better, because we actually have a combat
system, they are just running and falling, we will have a lot more
like let's say complex system where people will be able to fight. But
we love that jump and dive mechanic. So we would love to use to use
that. And also about something else. The skill based, which is the
skill level that is needed in for guys, it's actually amazing.
Somebody that has never touched PC can just start playing almost
instantly in it the learning curve. But it's the game which is easy
to start and very hard to master. And we love that idea and how it's
turning out. And we would love to, to have the absolutely same thing.
All the casual in bitcore players should be able to, like easily be
on boarded. And afterwards, hard to master the game hard to like
understand how the physics work how everything works the same. If
they want to grind up to the point that they are one of the best,
they will have to play a lot. But if they're just starting out, they
should be able to play easily. So we're going to that audience which
is casual to meet core players. So we love for guys.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
of course we love them. Also, they did like 35 million in revenue,
like in one month or something when they launched. But But yeah, it's
it's it's a good game, they messed up a bit when they transition
between free to, like the paid and free to play model. But it's it's
a lot of data that we have now both from like traditional games like
for guys and from web to native games. So we're doing a lot of
consulting work and design, not only around the game loop, but also
in terms of different things in different file sets. So so we really
align incentives and make these rich, rich experience that is just
not available in web two. But four guys, yeah, and, of course, the
design of the maps, which is really, really interesting. It's, it's a
big bonus. But again, here, we can up it a lot, just giving an
example we have, like five or six big YouTubers in their communities
already partnering. And what they do is they usually have a lot of
people in their discord servers playing for guys, but our proposition
is, alright, we're gonna give you a free land plot in our game, so
you'll be able to customise it. And all of your people with crypto
mites, they'll be able to have badgers like to feel from the same
family. And you can also do some streaming inside the game. So that
just what is possible in web three is just on another level and very
happy to see all the people developing some cool stuff.</font></p>

That's, that's super quiet. I was not actually, I guess, aware of
that. But that's, that's awesome. Because I've been playing a lot of
foul guys with my friends recently. So I'm very excited to be able
to, to play around with this once this goes live. So I guess like for
the in game functionality is going to be because I know you've
mentioned there's mazes, and there's puzzles for people to basically
go through or the I guess obstacles going to be sort of similar. And
I guess is there anything that you can compare some of the boss
battles to in terms of I guess some of the like, is how the end game
functionality works? Because I I assume it's like a third person type
of player view. And then I guess a lot of the in game mechanics are
going to be sort of similar in that regard. Is that Is that something
that you can sort of touch on?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yes,
so there is going to be interview but think of it that it's not going
to be the same because we're mainly focusing on mobile. So it will be
like a lot smoother than four guys where you have to take your mouse
so the time to look in the right direction. Alex will be with
joystick which is rotating automatically, and about the bosses.
Actually, we have multiple types of battles. And we're still testing
absolutely everything and options about this. But we have, let's say,
for example, you think this like a normal MMO RPG, where people will
be able to just fight with I mean, with the very good physics, of
course, they fight with the boss, but they have some bosses which are
very special, where they are going away from you, you find them in
the maze with your guild members and other people find them at the
same time. And they calculate the best way to start running away from
you, inside of the maze. So you start chasing them together with
other people, when you're fighting each other, only stunning each
other not not killing it with other people. But that together with
your guild mates, to for example, stone walk the boss for a couple of
seconds to do the most damage. So if it's this kind of a boss where
you have to do the most damage. In that case, you will be the winner
at the end of the maze, or when you kill him and you will get NFT
rewards at the end of the maze and your guild mates also. Or if
you're in a party, or there might be some mazes where you have to
last hit the boss, maybe he's on lower HP. And you're hitting him a
couple of times with your buddies and you get into the low HP and
then a very good RNG element comes into play with a random player,
which is not from a guilt just comes in that last shot the boss and
steals the reward, which might be possible in our game. Because we
love RNG elements, especially in games, and it gives a very fun
feeling. Let's say it like that. So we are very, let's say unique in
that aspect. Because I have searched and played for a long time, a
lot of games, and I haven't seen anything similar. So we have a very
good, unique elements into this. We're bringing something very good
thing new. Very cool.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">So
you mentioned that you guys are offering obviously you have this PvE
aspect where you're going and fighting bosses. But I I mean, correct
me if I'm wrong. It sounds like you mentioned that there's also PvP
aspects to it as well. So art, I guess players are able to battle
other individual players, are they kind of fighting each other to
like get to the end of like a maze as an example, in like a battle
royale type of thing. But you're not actually battling other players.
Is that correct?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">So
let me ask you this, because we don't have the perfectly correct
answer to this right now. Because the first version was that you will
not be able to kill other clerics only to stun them and slow them
down so that you do the most damage and kill the boss. And that was
the first version that we were thinking about. But the more
brainstorming we did, the more ideas we got from the community, we
started evolving it into more of a fighting one. But we are still
deciding if if we want to go to the killing of other people way,
because that will give a lot more complexity or we're going to lose a
lot of the casual players. And it will go into the more hardcore mode
game where you have a lot bigger tactics in killing who when and it's
gonna add, it's gonna make it a little bit more hardcore. And we're
still debating on if we want that exact type of battles or just
studying and slowing down other players. So yeah.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Okay,
that is definitely not something that I've actually thought about.
That makes a lot of sense. I think that's probably one of the reasons
why I like I call foul guys. I call that my potato mood game where
it's like, I'm basically turning into a potato and I'm my brain just
turns to mush. Or I just don't have to think about it. I have to like
focus. I'm just like, Alright, I'm gonna mess around and play a
little bit. So that definitely makes a lot of sense. But I've never
really thought about I guess, like the differences that some of those
in game mechanics can cause so very cool. That is really cool. Never
never really thought about that.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
so to jump to to jump in. I just every tutorial supposed to do I
always want to repeat something like creating a game is hard.
Creating a game in web three is harder. and creating it in a way that
we want to do it, which is like a scene is like it needs many
iterations. So the things you are seeing now that you're posting,
already, I mean, this is already out, like the demo that will do will
be out in two months. And there's a lot of work that will be done a
lot of play testing. Because there are a lot of moving parts. And I'm
very big on data. I love data driven decisions and things. So some of
the decisions, for example, the different models, of course, you will
be related to, even if you aren't user retention, if you want. So
there's a lot of metrics that come into place that will finally shape
the whole product. But still, that's the part where community and
other builders can take over, because part of the supply, a very big
part is intended for rewarding meaningful participation in the whole
ecosystem, not only in crypto maze, but for example, if you want to
create a game using the same assets using the same token, you can do
it so I'm very excited to to reach the part where the community and
other designers game devs start creating moths within the ecosystem,
it will be awesome because one of the funniest games I've played
started as a kind of site motto something</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">that's
cool. Thank you for thank you for that insight. Yeah, it's, I guess
that's, that kind of comes down to the whole aspect of building on
almost anything at this point where you're going to be in two or
three months down the line. I mean, this space moves very quickly, so
you gotta you gotta stay on top of everything. But um, cool. So I
guess with your, with these crypto mites, or I guess different in
game characters, you've mentioned that they're able to evolve,
they're able to sort of grow like I don't know if if anyone here
isn't, I guess a gamer themselves. The best way that I can give like
a comparison is oh, it's like going from chars are or chars are to
turn it or char hander to chars are like you're evolving as like a
character and endgame I guess item, are these NF T's? Are they
essentially dynamic and able to be upgraded? Or are they more so
static? Nf Ts? And are you generating I guess experience for them to
be able to upgrade them?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>CryptoMaze

 </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
so let me start the first part of the question. Currently, the
Genesis collection are static, they are not dynamic entities, because
there is something to that collection that I have discussed. And we
prefer these genuine to stay as it is, like, like a rare item that
the people who are so so so early have, but the other crypto mods
that people will usually get for free or to play will most likely be
dynamic NF T's because the whole idea is to level up your character.
Now, not sure if the correct where we'll be like mutation from like
Pikachu to mega peak amount or something. But the levelling system
will be for sure implemented along with kind of seasons. I don't want
to call it the Battle Pass. But it's very important this just to be
able to start with zero and just with time, skill, and like doubt and
connecting with friends to be able to level up and even surpass the
status of these origin ones, which are more like kind of a flex to be
honest, because there's a certain line when in web three games we
have to, like we have a lot of respect for the early community, which
will reward a lot a lot. But at some point when the game starts, we
have to like stop thinking with our investment hat and start thinking
about the gaming in game design game like the user experience And so
the levelling system will be in place, for sure. And the other part
is still curious to see how because because the concept of using
different FFTs from different collections in our game, oh, is this
something in our minds and like interesting for the web three
community, but thinking that it doesn't have to have like, visual
transformation. For example, the crypto might can level up, but
doesn't need to become like super bumpy kryptonite or something like
that. But if, for example, you have a high rarity bar tape a and you
wanna come into our universe, I think that should be able to be done.
But it doesn't necessarily need to be the same eight. I mean, like,
how can I explain it? For example, if you have a vehicle in another
game, for example, a sports car, and you bring it with your
reputation, your friends list into the crypto mess, you login. Now
that then if he can transfer to something else, which is meaningful
in our ecosystem? I hope I managed to explain it a bit clearer.</font></p>

building this out as a mobile game. Do you have any plans to build it
out, I guess, as a web application? Or are you entirely focused on

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">In
the beginning, we decided to go with the demo to be as a web browser
game. But afterwards, the game needs to be fully mobile. And we have
been working a lot from making it on mobile optimising it and all the
heroes and all that assets, low polygons and optimise so that we will
be able to achieve this on the mobile because if we made the designs,
then if these a little bit too high quality, we wouldn't be able to
play them on mobile. So we're mainly looking for mobile, but the demo
version will be on the web browser, it will be played and it will be
easy to for everybody to check it out if they have a keep in mind.

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, serif">Yeah,
so for some things, we'll do baby steps. One of these things is like
how because like in crypto, I have seen a lot of projects, just
launching products just at the wrong time when the market wasn't
ready for that. And, and I see still want to see a bit more
infrastructure around this. Basically user user onboarding, like,
because it has to be very easy, very, very seamless. So there are a
lot of people who work around that. So we'll just see what what makes
sense for us. And, and yeah, we'll be mobile focused. But things like
the account creation, we'll see what we can do for the account
obstruction with GK seeing, like, of course, multi transaction
sessions, everything like that. But to me, it's not the main focus at
the moment, because there's still time and we just love to learn from
others. For example, we've learned a bunch from Maxi a bunch from you
love yum. So now we can focus on some things that are essential for
our product and something we'll just use what's was the best out
there. So yeah.</font></p>

another L two on air with another team that is actually building on z
k sync as well. So make sure to tune in and learn more about some of
the teams that are building some innovative technologies on top of
some of these incredibly powerful layer two solutions. Obviously one
of them being crypto amis. I've been personally I've been very
