Well, I'm glad we we got that sorted out. And thank you for joining.
For those of you who this is your first time joining one of our
Twitter spaces. Thank you and welcome, and look forward to talking
more with the space fie team about what they're working on. So for
those of you who who have not joined before, welcome to your first L
two on air. My name is Mark and set. I'm one of the co founders of
numio, which is a noncustodial mobile wallet on Aetherium primarily
focused around Aetherium layer two. And today we're going to be
talking with the space five team and learning more about what they
are working on. So without further ado, feel free to introduce
yourself I don't know if you prefer to stay and none or you want to
give out your name. But all what you do is as you feel comfortable.
And then we can jump into space five</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Hi,
I'm I'm suppose right now I'm representing spacefi. So we'll be an
entre today. But space phi team do intend to be more transparent as
time goes on. For a lot of people in our Discord if you pay attention
to who the admins are, chances are we Doc's ourselves already. So
just for the purpose of today, we're anonymous. So our team is based
phi.io. And we're cross chain, we have three platform with quite a
few features. In our list. We have decks, we have a list of NF T's.
We have our version of decentralised social network called Spacebase.
And our version of Launchpad code starter, and right now we're on F
mo sunset casing. And we're rolling out most of our products. As of
right now we have the dex the NF T and the social, the decentralised
social media aspects already ready. And we only have the launch pack,
which is for our community, that's actually the least technically
demanding part. And that's the last part that we have to launch as
per our roadmap. We'll be having most of our features up on all the
main net soon both f Mohsen Zed K sync with Zed K sync, being online
quite soon. So with our initial product beings Adex, the NFT and the
space space, our ultimate vision is to connect the cosmos ecosystem
to the layer two ecosystem for Aetherium. And on the way we'll be
exploring cross chain assets and solutions for interoperability, and
composability. So with a Dex it's pretty straightforward. As most XR
we have the decentralised exchange, as well as the very commonly seen
features such as healed farming, and we also have single sided
farming for our NFCs you can swap for I'm meant or stake them. And
they, we also have NFT staking, which will provide extra incentive
for people using our NF Ts, as well as providing whitelist SWAT for
the launchpad, once our launch pads is online, which you can get
through using these NF T's. As far as a space base, we, each person
can create the space base using our token. And this is kind of like a
small group chat, where most stuff space five features will be open.
And we've been on F motions at K sync test net for quite a while. We
went from about 100 members to about almost 60,000 members now. And
considering the situation in the ecosystem, we are probably one of
the most active projects. And we are actually very ahead in terms of
our roadmap deployments, with everything but the launch pad ready. So
just recently, about a week ago, we enabled the minting of our NFT.
And the full main net launch is going to be done very soon.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome,
very cool. So for those of you who aren't really keeping up with that
they have definitely a lot going on. And I'm going to try and sort of
break down some of these individual, I would say like roadmap items
that you do have, so we can kind of get a little bit more of an
understanding of what's going on there. I'm probably not going to ask
too many questions about the depths and what you're doing there. I
feel like that would be quite straightforward. And I would love to
definitely learn more about what you're doing, specifically with the
bridge and what you're doing around NF T's because there's a lot of I
would say, cool things you can do about that. And I think what we
could do is first start off on on the bridge side of things. So I
believe you all are the first bridge to be building between cosmos or
even even Ed most necessarily know exactly how to say it EVM OS,
whatever works, and z k sync. And so what was sort of like your your
team's rationale between wanting to bridge the cosmos ecosystem with
whether it be z k sync, or just like the Ethereum layer two
ecosystem? What was sort of like your rationale between behind
wanting to do that? And I guess, are you focused on building
generalised bridging solutions between various chains? Or are you
mainly looking at bridging, like the cosmos ecosystem with the layer
two ecosystem?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>SpaceFi
 13:11</b>  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
in terms of why we build a bridge, we're working on building a bridge
between cosmos and that casing. Obviously, when you're building cross
chain solutions, you you want to build a better experience for for
the users using your web three products. And, of course, you can use
third party bridging solutions. But we do want to have a very simple
to use a very easily wrapped UI where it's painless, seamless
experience for our users. And the key of why we do it between f most
and Z F k sync specifically, is because obviously these are the
platforms that we took some time to choose all the reasoning between
how how great F motion is with EVM compatible decentralised
applications and Zeb K sync with not just very commonly seen improved
operability of layer twos but also the more privacy focused
solutions. And building a bridge between f Mo's and cosmos in general
with set k sink will push towards a better experience for our
ecosystem. And with that in mind, we focus on this instead of a more
generalised rich solution. So in terms of why we weave Want to focus
on this? Moving from a multi chain ecosystem, as what we have right
now to being cross chain on your own has been a very important goal
for us. And that means we need interoperability. And that means we
need ease of use. And that means we need performance. And this is
what we think what drive cross chain and multi chain web three app
from being a peculiarity to popularity. With our focus to be slightly
different, we already have quite a strong economy and ecosystem. And
considering this, we have our choice of why we choose Atmos, it's
since cosmos is one of the largest solutions for your own blockchain
and your own ecosystem. And naturally Aetherium and EVM is the
largest bar non blockchain application ecosystem. And being the EVM
harp on Cosmos F most will connect these two worlds. And in terms of
layer two, we chose that casing. It's one of the if not the best, and
the most well recognise representative of ZenPayroll up and naturally
being an L two of Aetherium. It's very well compatible with EVM. And
with these two in mind, this is our difference, so to speak. We do it
for our not just for for for our ecosystem, but as a choice between
two very, very accomplished chains in the ecosystem. So yeah, that's
the answer for that.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Very
cool. And thank you for that. I would love to I guess get an idea in
terms of I guess feedback because I know you've mentioned that you've
you've been on test net for quite some time both on EVA most and or
Evie most and NZ K sync on both of their test nets. What was the
deployment process like with going on to event most are? Honestly I
keep screwing up how to say it, but I'm going to I'm going to keep
bumbling around with it. Because I know I was reading a few things a
few months ago about their launch, when they went live that there
were there were some I would say like difficulties or obstacles that
developers were sort of overcoming and I believe users essentially
just interacting with the chain. What was I guess like the deployment
process like for that and where are things at with that ecosystem
now?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
from the start from the get go, that deployments on fmoS not just
back then but also recently with the very unfortunate happening with
Nomad one of the key bridges for Atmos and Cosmos. It's been it's
been a challenge to say it lightly. Cosmos on its own is a huge huge
cross chain solution. We've seen so many chains building on top of
Cosmos it's it's such a back it's such a backbone for so many
blockchain ecosystem to sprout on top on and EVM EVM being EVM it's
the it's the largest blockchain application ecosystem and and
bridging these two costs cosmos and Aetherium into something like
Atmos is no small task. So at the start our our fortune was that we
work very closely with the cosmos and F most team in order to
integrate what we want. And prior to the launch on F most we did have
another main net on an EVM compatible ecosystem already. So what we
had to do at the time was just work really closely with the Atmos
team to change that EVM compatible ecosystem into a F most compatible
ecosystem. And as the challenges and the issues and the bugs of F
Mo's were found and were overcome, so did we. And with the with the
unfortunate happening of the Nomad bridge, also one of our partners.
It's one of the reasons why we would like to be more hands on and
more proactive with our own bridging solutions. But, of course, it's
to support not just our users, but to work with the utmost team as
well on all these integrations, and to allow our ecosystem to start
branching off and growing on its own. And yeah, it's been a struggle,
but we've been working really closely. And whatever issue there was,
we experienced the same thing. And we overcame it. And that's also
partly why we've been very active on test net, and moving back and
forth between should we should we not launch on Main net? And, yeah,
now that it feels quite stable. And now when it feels challenges
behind us? We're working again closely with the Atmos team, so that
we could finally fully beyond main net.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Awesome,
thank you for that, that definitely makes sense. Appreciate the
feedback on that. Because I I don't know personally, I don't know
that many teams that are building, specifically around the Atmos
ecosystem. And by the way, I'll give I'll give myself a little pat on
the back. I believe I actually just said it correctly for the first
time. So go me. But I haven't really talked to too many teams that
are building around ethnos. So really appreciate some of your, your
feedback and thoughts there. That's that's, that's very interesting.
And very excited to see some of these different types of EVM
Compatible Solutions deploying on some of these native chains. And
some of these, I would say EVM compatible ecosystems, I think that's
going to be the one of the biggest tools that we're seeing for a lot
of these non EVM compatible chains to enable support for I know,
we're seeing that with CK sync with what they're doing with with
their compiler. And I know other teams are building various compilers
or transpilers for I would say, quote, unquote, native EVM
compatibility. So really looking forward to, to seeing those
ecosystems continue to grow and evolve. But sort of back to to space
phi and some of the things that you're working on. I always get
fascinated by some of the concepts that people are doing specifically
around NF Ts. So are you all planning to build your own metaverse?
Because I know you have the ability to go and mint, various types of
NF T's with different types of rarity. And I guess, what's the
process with regards to minting one of your NF T's like what do you
need to do? What does it essentially give you? What are you able to
essentially do with it? So yeah, I would love to I would love to
learn more about that.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Sure.
About the gaming economy and Metaverse aspect, we're actually not
working on a game fi or, or Metaverse, though, so to speak, this is
less game fi. If not nothing related to gaming at all, this is more
gamification of value capture through NFC. And the way that we do it
is we make it more fun to collect, to grow and of course it makes it
we make it profitable to do so. So we we attempt to capture the the
value into our NFT ecosystem through minting and swapping so you
meant a bunch of Commons and then you swap it into a unique and then
once you've amassed a certain amount of uniques you meant and
exclusive and each time when you meant or when you swap you will get
like a random extra multiplier that is unique to this NFT that you
just made. So no two unique NF T's are the same. No two exclusive NF
T's are the same. And obviously you know two common NF T's are the
same even though even though they might have similar names or, or
similar tags. And the reason why they're different is to inject a
certain random gamification aspect into it. And what it does is that
these multipliers will affect the NF T's ability to single side stake
in order to farm star token, which is our ecosystem token. And this
will allow NF T's of the same tier to earn different levels of
rewards. And of course, if you wrap them up and swap for a higher
tier, you earn higher rewards. And almost always NFT farming is going
to be better than regular say, yield farming or single sided token
farming and so on. And aside from just doing the farming, holders of
the NF T's will get bonuses such as bonus from our minting fee from
our trading fee, from the fee that people use, people pay to join our
space basis. And one of the more important aspects will be the
commission from our validator in fmoS. We're actually, of course,
this number changes day to day. But if I'm not mistaken, we're
somewhere within the top, top 10 or Top 20 Top validators for the
Atmos ecosystem, which is pretty huge considering that we just joined
this space about a month ago. And this will undoubtedly be more
valuable as time goes on when the EFF most ecosystem gets even
bigger. And this commission from the validator bonus will be pretty
huge as as time goes on. And of course, one of the very common ways
to earn from your NF T's is just selling them. And seeing that we
have a limited amount, and you have to race with others to mint and
swab instead of just praying that you get it. This will have a not
just a scarcity based on RNG luck, but also a scarcity based on how
how early you are and how well you played your swamping. So basically
just a more fun way to get your profit and a lot more variety and the
use cases for NF T's. And by doing so, we intend to have the NFT as a
more integral part of the ecosystem and to aid with sustainable
growth for spaceflight, not just the NFT side, but also the way that
it attaches to the decks to the launch pad to the decentralised
social media as a whole. Yeah.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Got
it interesting. So when I go to essentially meant a planet, does
that, in of itself contain, I guess, like your native token star? Or
am I staking that only would I only be staking that to essentially
earn rewards in that manner? Or would I be essentially earning
rewards from the NFT by just holding it</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">so
you will have to stake that NFT and the NFT just by having the NFC in
your wallet. I mean of course you'll have AirDrop from time to time
as as we do it to our NFT holders and you will still get the star
tokens from our minting fee trading fee and social media fee and
validate a commission but you won't be having the NFT staking bonus.
So you can choose to either stake it and get the entire reward or
just hold it in your wallet be more flexible but obviously that means
lower level of star AirDrop to you</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">got
it. Okay. And then when I want to go and I guess mint, other I guess
technically more rare NF T's like let's say like I'm looking at your
website. You can go and mint like a unique planet and then I quote
unquote exclusive star planet. Other than I guess, receiving a higher
multiplier, are there any other benefits for minting some of these
like higher rarity NF T's or is there anything else? is going on
