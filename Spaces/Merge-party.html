<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Hey
everyone, welcome. I'm super fizz from the east staker community. If
you are watching, right now you're coming to the painting party, we
are there doing a warm up for the main net merge call. So continue to
paint. I'm about to throw you the introduction for the main call. So
don't don't panic, this is not the main net merge call. We're just
getting warmed up. So hey, everyone, welcome to the Aetherium main
net merge call, hosted by bank lists the Etherium cat herders, the
daily Gwei and eat staker. We're really glad to have you here
tonight, our call is going to last probably about two hours, as we
spend an hour leading up to the merge, and then an hour processing
the merge afterwards. We're joined here today by Aetherium,
implementers, and researchers and a lot of community oriented guests.
So we're really glad to have you. One thing I want to let you know,
before we get started is we are streaming from the Aetherium
foundation YouTube channel. But this is not an Aetherium foundation
production. What we did was look for a common ground where a lot of
communities could come together in one place and share the merge with
you. And the Etherion foundation channel seemed like the right place.
So we are the community. And we're glad you're here with us. So
David, do you want to say hello?</font></p>

up everyone? I'm actually hearing looking at the chat and saying that
the volume is basically zero. You might need to fix that before we
continue with the stream. Who who's managing the stream
infrastructure? Michael Baetica. You working on it? Okay. All right.
I'll tell Chad to calm down.</font></p>

you, David and Anthony. Hello, let's get going. From the Aetherium
carriers, so glad to have you. And once again, I am super fizz from
the east staker community and I'm so glad to have the East acre crew
here with us tonight. So welcome everyone. Before we get going, we're
going to check out a two minute video that we just thought was a
really cool futuristic imagination and a really cool somebody hit me
with a word and take on the merge a really cool imagining of the
future of Aetherium so sit back buckle in and let's let's get to it.
All right, yeah, so that's my intro. It's not going to be the same.

so for anybody that is watching that isn't taking part of this
canvas, you are definitely free to do so. All you need to do is get
one of the many entry poll apps. And if you don't have one, there's
also a party entry popup. And I guess maybe I can mention someone's
Twitter, we all share this same sort of invitation. There is a link
there. So you can go grab that poll app if you need it. It requires a
point 001 eath donation to what is it again stateful. Safe works.
Stefan works. Yeah. Which are some of the people that helped make
Aetherium what it is, so it's definitely going to a good cause. Also,
if you have friends that have ng po apps, they can also just delegate
them to you as well. So they can give you a pixel pricing power. And
a neat feature of this canvas, just two things I really want to
mention. You can choose colours in the palette on the right, but
sorry, I forgot. Firstly, to sign in with your wallet that contains
any of the entry pro apps. And then there's a palette on the bottom
right where you can choose something like 256 colours. And also a
neat thing to like. The feature that helps you collaborate with
people is you can quickly see what colour they're using by right
clicking it and copying their colour. So yeah, that's that's about
it. It's pretty simple. If you want to do some last minute
coordination with the community, there's also a discord link in a
tweet that I can only mention because I don't know where I can share
it</font></p>

painting party. We are not live on the call. The call will start when
we are an hour from TTD. So right now, really, we're just warming up
and visiting this. While this is streaming live on the channel right
now this will not be a part of the long term video this will be
trimmed out. So yeah, hang out, join us. I may run through my intro.
One more time just to make sure that we're all comfortable that for
me, the hardest part of any call is the intro. Like once you get over
that hump, then things kind of do their own take care of themselves.

hanging out for a while watching Buddha eat his lunch and
participating in the co op art canvas. And that will last until about
one hour before TTD. When we get to one hour before TTV. We're going
to kind of start a blank slate. We're going to go off for a few
minutes. We're going to regroup with this room. We're going to plan
it and then we're going to pop back in and I'm going to say hello
everyone welcome to Do the Etherium main net merge call, blah, blah,

it's just enjoying the painting party. I encourage everyone to get
100 pixels down if you can, and they need to stay. I can't tell you
why, because it would be non germane. But it wouldn't be cool. If you
were able to do that. One of the best ways to do that is to
contribute to the main theme, which you will see as a panda in the
middle. Because as a part of the canvas that we expect to romaine,
you're likely not to be wiped out there.</font></p>

my mom, who is just an educator, like a teacher, or like a curriculum

was like, the one thing she she messed up on, she was like, you know,
I explained that there was like, the normal theory of network and
there was like rinky dink or something. I'm like, do you mean
Rinkeby? And she's like, Yeah, yeah. Rinkeby. And I explained that

the launch of the beacon chain. I went to go visit my grandmother.
And she was asking me what I was doing, I'd recently quit my job. And
I told her I was working, you know, generally in this community
called Aetherium. And she asked me, she's like, what's that? And I
was like, okay, and I sat down with her for 45 minutes. And I sort of
walked her through, like, what Aetherium is and what it could be used
for and things and use analogy, like her local Savings Bank and
things and she really got it. And it was really cool. And ever since
then, she'll always ask me, she'll be she sees a theorem in the news
all the time. She's like, she'll send me articles to be like, hey,
Kofax like I saw it, tear him in the news. Like, do you know about
this? Like, I just wanted to let you know. And I'm like, You're just
this is amazing. I don't know it's always heartwarming. When I hear
from her she always asked me like, hey, like, is this does this

super excited. So it's getting really fun. But, I mean, I don't
really I missed the first half in general, I just tuned in because
it's getting set up. But a personal note I assume about at the
communities, if not correct me. But it's been kind of an amazing past
five years, like especially with mobile, we kind of got to see so
much of this space evolve and change and just grow it's to me a
wonderful thing that not only are there people that have kind of come
to the web three system and specifically theory and ecosystem from a
bunch of events but also that they kind of stick around and help and
contribute and make this ecosystem even better. So to me it's more
about like the meta observation as we never realised or predicted the
impact any of these things would have and just kind of seeing that
perturb and just to me like the most mind blowing and I see that
every day whether the person sitting sharing the excitement about
what they've done to somebody send you an email to somebody say hey I
want to do this or I want to see more of this. That's the best part
about physical space</font></p>

want to say how excited I am For personal reasons to get past the
merge, because I've been pouring so much energy into promoting
decentralisation on the chain, that I've really taken time away from
my family. And so I was talking to my son today, he's three. And I'm
like, today's a really big Workday for Daddy, I'm going to be online
and all day. And I said, what we're going to merge, and after the
merge is over, I'm going to have a lot of time to play. And so all
day long, he's been saying, Have you merged yet is the merge done.
And I'm like, well, it's gonna be a little bit later. And so it's
gonna be late tonight. And so this evening after his bath, he's like,
is the merge done. And I'm like, he, like he's so excited about it.
And I'm really looking forward to like, getting past this big hump,
so that I can refocus my attention for a while on my family. And it's
fun to be passionate about Aetherium. And I love this opportunity to
express my passion. But I'm also looking forward to an opportunity to

about 20 minutes. Before we do that, so if you're painting, you can
continue painting all the way through the formal call. And until we
finalise So, this is going to be a joke, just to prepare you so that
means you'll have about nine hours left in the painting party Eames

it will be one hour before main net merge. And we'll begin that come

And so just just for the record, we still have time, there's some
discrepancy about when TTD is actually going to happen. Whether it's
going to be one hour from now or two hours from now when we retweet
that and then we can discuss because kind of what I'm feeling like is
when we go dark for a while to organise, we're not going to come back
until we start the main net merge call. And if that's like an hour,
then it's probably longer than we wanted to be offline.</font></p>

Hello everyone, welcome I'm super fist from the Eat staker community.
And I have been waiting for a couple of years to see you all on this
call. So it's it's so great to be here with everyone. This is the
Etherium main net merge viewing call, we're looking forward to the
Etherium main net merge, that is the the transition from proof of
work to proof of stake to occur in about an hour. And in that hour,
we kind of want to celebrate, educate and just share this experience
with you. Tonight's call is going to be hosted by bank lists, the
daily Gwei Aetherium cat herders, and each staker the organisation I
work with. We're also joined by client implementation teams,
researchers, and a lot of other community contributors. And I'm so
glad to see such a wide range of folks here tonight.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">It's
important to let you know before we start, this call is being hosted
on the Aetherium foundation channel. And the Etherion foundation is
kind of an official organisation that supports Aetherium development.
But in fact this call is being run by the community The four
organisations that I mentioned bakeless, Staley, Gwei, Aetherium, cat
herders and East diggers, we're all community organised. But we
wanted to find kind of a common middle ground where we could come
together and not not like split up into our own calls, we wanted to
come together, bring every one of the community together into one
place, and really merge together. And so we borrowed the Etherion
foundation channel. There are lots of folks here from the Etherion
foundation joining us. But I want to point out this is first and
foremost, a community call a celebration. And to that extent, what
what you hear tonight should not necessarily be regarded as official.
This, this is primarily a celebration of the merge, not necessarily a
technical overview of the merge. The most important thing to
remember, we don't know what's going to happen in an hour after we
see pandas and after we wait for finalisation, if you're a
journalist, if you're someone who's going to be reporting on Twitter,
about what's happening tonight, I urge you to, to, to not regard this
as canon. Because what's very likely to happen are sources that we're
looking at websites that we're looking at information that we're
looking at, could very easily go down or be wrong. And the best
practice is to wait until you hear official notice. Even official
notice from well regarded tweeters, like Vitalik Buterin, or Danny
Ryan or Tim Paco. Those sources of information are great final
sources of information. And this call really should be regarded as a
celebration and information, not a source of cannon about how the
merge went. And I'm just saying that in advance because I don't know
any more than than you do, what's going to happen in an hour. And I
the last thing I want is to have a misunderstanding based on our
celebration. So again, I'm joined by a super fish from East acre. I'm
joined by David Hoffman from bank lists, David, how are you?</font></p>

both. It was both long awaited and actually kind of unreal that it's
actually happening. But of course, I think we're all here to see some
pandas show up on the screen. A little bit, a little bit of chaos
after that, and then some clarity after that. So that's what I'm
looking forward to.</font></p>

excited that everyone showed up tonight. And I'm glad that everyone
watching on YouTube on eath global or wherever you're consuming this.
Really glad to see everyone this tonight. Before we go too much
further, we have we have a two minute video we'd like to share with
everyone. And so the idea is, we'll share this video and then after
that we'll talk about the the agenda for the show. But so it's a two
minute video that kind of gives a futuristic, a wildly futuristic and
exceptionally wild futuristic concept of what the future of a theory
involves. It's kind of fun, kind of futuristic, but I'm vedika if you
can go ahead and fire that off we will hang out and watch</font></p>

I saw that video and I just I felt like that had to go out like it
was just an incredible futuristic perspective. I don't know I'm kind
of blown away by it. Next, I'd like to introduce an E staker NYX aura
Kish. She began by providing community support in the East staker
Reddit. And she's a perfect example of someone who just wanted to
commit to the community. And because of that we on boarded her to
East take her full time. It she's just an an exceptional example of
someone who made their way in by committing time to the success of
Aetherium. And so I'm really glad to introduce Nix Orchis to share

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Hi,
everyone. So first thing we're going to do is we're going to have a
few accessible talks. And the point of these talks are to be geared
towards people who don't necessarily see spend all of their time in
the Aetherium ecosystem. So you're going to hear from Tim Bayko
Vitalik puja of theory and cat herders fizz and in the middle of that
you will hear a song from Jonathan man. And then we will go to Danny
Ryan, who will show us what we're looking for, to see that the merge
is successful and hope he'll walk you through I'm Remy, will Remi
arrive eat staker will walk us through sort of a technical overview
of what's happening. And after that, we'll watch pandas, we'll watch
pandas when Remy is talking. And then we'll wrap up, the painting
party will see the canvas close, we will give you pro app details. So
don't ask one poll up until the end. And then there will be a
community q&amp;a. And you can find that that slider link in some of
the more technical discord. So if you're looking to answer a
question, or ask a question, go find that slider link. And then we
will close the call.</font></p>

thanks for the agenda overview. So we recognise that many people who
are watching know more about Aetherium than people in this room. And
that's that's so exciting. But we also want to welcome people who
have no idea what's going on, they've never heard of Aetherium, they
found this video, and we want to spend this call kind of educating
you about what Aetherium is and where it's headed. And so we've kind
of tapped David Hoffman from bank lists. David, can you tell us? What
is the merge? And how does it fit into the greater context?</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Now,
what is the merge? What are we all doing here watching this stream?
The merge is a long time coming of the arrival of proof of stake to
Aetherium. That's really what it is. It's Ethereum transitioning into
proof of stake. And this has been a goal of Aetherium. For years.
Now, since Genesis, it has always been the goal for Aetherium to
migrate eventually, from proof of work to proof of stake. And the
merge has been the mechanism of which we actually get that done. Why
is it called the merge. That's because there's currently two
blockchains running in parallel right now, the main proof of work
Aetherium chain, the chain that we know is called Aetherium, the one
that we know, and there's also this other chain called the beacon
chain. Now, the beacon chain really just does one thing, it does one
thing and one thing alone, which is B proof of stake, it's all it
does, there's no transactions, there's no tokens, it just validates
itself in a proof of stake fashion, and it's using ether that's been
deposited on the main Aetherium chain. And then this new beacon chain
listens to that if main Aetherium chain for ether deposits. And that
is how ether becomes heard and acknowledged and then answered and
exists on the beacon chain, the beacon chain launched in December of
2020. And it's been a blockchain that's just been validating as a
proof of stake blockchain ever since then. And now that it is stable,
and now that the developers feel secure, we are merging with that
beacon chain. And so as we approach what we are all talking about, as
seeing the pandas with us really merge meaning is that the current
Aetherium chain is intersecting with the beacon chain. And the proof
of stake component of the beacon chain is like bumping out the proof
of work miners for the Ethereum, the main Aetherium consensus. And so
this merge, what we are all here for today on the stream, is to watch
the event where the beacon chain, the proof of stake consensus of the
beacon chain becomes the actual consensus of the main Aetherium
chain. And all of the various clients. There are many clients of
Aetherium, there's different instead of one, canonical Aetherium,
there's a five, six, many different clients of Aetherium. And the
each one of these are syncing with each other, and the beacon chain
to all listen to the beacon chain all at the same time, all at the
same way as the TTD number, total terminal difficulty, a very large
number, once we hit that number, all of a sudden, the main Aetherium
chain will start to listen to the beacon chain instead of the miners.
And in that moment, we will have merged with the beacon chain and
become proof of stake. So fits that is what the merge is. And that is
why we're all here today on this live stream.</font></p>

explained, but why are we doing this? Right? It has been a long time
coming. We have been talking about it for many, many different years.
There are a bunch of different reasons why people are excited about
it. But I think that a lot of people in the audience and just
generally would love to know why we're doing this. You know how, how
we kind of like view this as a community and who better to explain

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Well,
yeah, thanks, everyone for tuning in and watching. So yeah, I'll talk
quickly about what the merge does for end users and generally for
Aetherium. And maybe a good way to start this is to focus on, you
know, the average user of Aetherium, who just wants to transact on
chain. And we actually worked quite hard so that for all those users,
the merge does basically nothing in terms of their experience. So if
they send a transaction, like if you're sending a transaction in an
hour, whether it lands on the last proof of work block, or the first
proof of steak Lodge, it doesn't affect your transaction, you don't
need to do anything. It'll just keep working. And that was like,
really important design goal. So that's all the users of Aetherium,
all the infrastructure, all the smart contracts, just keep working as
expected. So I see the chat that I've stolen someone's mic.
Hopefully, it's good. Thanks. Like client? Yeah, shout out to my
client. Yeah, so for users of a theory, I'm ready. The goal was like,
an extremely smooth transition. But then, you know, why do the merge
at all? What do we get at the network level. And Danny, who's here
likes to say there's like three things, sustainability, scalability,
and security. And sustainability is the one that gets talked about
the most these days. And it's quite obvious, you know, proof of work
uses physical resources to secure the network does have a very high
energy cost. This is what kind of goes in as a security for
Aetherium. Moving to proof of stake allows us to kind of get rid of
that entire energy expenditure that we use the security chain. And
you know, there's different, there's different estimates for this,
some people say like 99.9% 99.95, but I think that the way to look
about Alice's, it's almost a bit more like qualitative, like, on
proof of work, we have to keep growing the amount of hardware of
electricity that we use at the secure Aetherium. If you want the
chain to kind of grow and scale in, in size, our proof of stake we
don't need to do that. Like there's no not only that, we like stop
the use we have today, but there's no more growth rate. And we
benefit from any optimization in computing. So that's the first big
one, the second one around security. We could go on for a long time
for this. But I think an easy way to think about it. And for people
who might not be super familiar with like, all the details is proof
of work basically gives you like, a carrot to motivate people, right?
Like you give them coins if they do the right thing on the network.
And if you don't do the right thing, you don't get coins. And you
hope that this is a strong enough motivation for people to to do the
right thing. On proof of stake we can, we can keep doing that, we can
also introduce some conditions, where if validators do something
wrong, we can add some small penalties or some larger ones, in case
of, of greater things. So from a security perspective, it kind of
helps us bound the actions of the actors who like create the
consensus on the network. And that just helps us like fine tune kind
of the security of the network somewhere. And then the last minute,
around kind of scalability, the merge itself doesn't scale the
theory. I'm just like a big misconception. Um, but it does kind of
lay the infrastructure that we can use to then scale a theorem in the
future. So like the way we, we think about scaling a theorem is using
all these layer two solutions that exist today. They need to publish
all the data to the network. And that's relatively expensive to do
today. So we hope in the future to add kind of different layers to a
theorem, kind of a data layer where people can post can post data
They're for their tos. And having this validators already kind of
validating information about blocks, allows us to eventually kind of
add their add to their duties validating this data. So yeah, that's
pretty much it at a high level for users, smart contracts, everything
should be smooth for the network itself, we get much better
sustainability, better security. And it kind of lays the groundwork
for all of this scalability work.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
I finally have unmute permissions. And I use them. So amazing.
Awesome. Yeah. Great. Great. So why proof of stake? Right? I think so
proof of stake has obviously been a dream for the theory of
ecosystems, that's pretty much the beginning. Right. So we started
the proof of stake research with that blog post on SlideShare back in
January 2014. And then kept going through proof of stake L.
algorithms of different kinds can eventually figure it out, you know,
the nuances around weak subjectivity, that started researching this,
like BFT style of consensus, and over the next couple of years,
eventually came to having things like Casper FFG, and all of the
various ideas around CVC. And to the current plan, like started to
solidify sometime around 2018. And I've been Oh, finally, here we
are. So the motivations that we had for proof of stake, I think
there's a few of them. I mean, one is, at the big one, obviously,
it's just proof of work is very expensive, right? Like proof of work
basically involves the people maintaining the consensus of the
network, proving that they have read more resources that an attacker
can have by like, basically, those resources being these big
specialised computing boxes, that they that keep running 24/7 and
doing verifiable calculations with up to 84. Seven, just to keep
proving to the network that those computers exist. And, like, you can
see how that architecture is sort of credibly neutral, and
permissionless, to answer all of those things, but at the same time,
it's like, basically, the most expensive possible way to deal with
the fact that it's trying to do and proof of stake. Sometimes I used
to use the metaphor of virtual mining, where basically, it's like,
instead of having a miner in the real world consuming real
electricity, it's almost like what you deposit, the Ethereum network
simulates a virtual miner. And it's good, it's the same sort of
process, you put in capital, and that capital turns into a sub share
of the network and you get a right to participate in the network. As
a validator gets it produced some percentage of the blocks, but it
all happens in a simulated way without requiring any actual or
resource expenditure. So it's both better for the environment as well
as I guess like other non environmental externalities, like how proof
of work, just best says massively increased prices for GPUs and made
a bunch of gamers I agree, hands up proof of stake wala Zhu mo pretty
much had the exact opposite. And they'll probably even have a flood
of cheap GPUs for some time. But also, it is cheaper for the theory
of ecosystem itself. And that comes through in the form of not having
to have 5 million coins every year of issuance, right? So proof of
work requires about 5 million coins every year of issuance with proof
of stake the issuance is somewhere between</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yes,
real technically zero and 2 million coins. But in practice, it's, I
think, at about six 700,000 coins every year today. So it's much less
than 5 million. And even that that is issuance that is accessible to
you as an ether holder, if you decide to stake your eath right, so it
all I gotta say so within the ecosystem. So those are the efficiency
benefits, right? So good for the environment, it's gonna keep the
resources inside of the ecosystem. It's also has a bunch of different
side benefits, right? So censorship, resistance is an important one,
right? Like proof of work by Digg is something that takes up like
huge amounts of electricity, it's relatively easy to detect if people
were observing, it's actually good, but proof of stake or you know,
just to be on a laptop somewhere, and that's as easy to hide as
anything. It is more secure in a bunch of ways, right? So there's
this concept of economic finality where reverting even a single block
takes a A bunch of like, requires a third of validators to get
slashed once that block gets finalised, and even attacks that are not
kind of 100% provable, so don't think it's like censorship attacks,
there are base, a lot of those can be responded to by key beat by the
community with a community organised soft work, where you know what
one of the things he could do with proof of stake is like, you can
basically have this a soft fork where only the people who
participated in the attack would get kicked out of the validator set
and, you know, lose part of their deposits. But But everyone who is
in DOD participated, the attack would not, whereas in proof of work,
you you can sort of your only option is to change the proof of work
algorithm, which just like punishes everyone. And that requires a
hard fork. And it's much more like intrusive, it'd be usable in a
bunch of ways. So and then finally, a proof of steak also lays the
groundwork for scalability, because it gives us these validators will
validate our slots, and makes it easy for us to add other tasks
students, which would include validating sharted data that joy. So I
think like to summarise that one of the ways that I think about this
in a more philosophical way is like, proof of work is based on the
laws of physics. And so you sort of have to work with the world as it
is right? You have to work with, you know, electricity as it as
hardware as it is, what computers are, as it is, whereas because
proof of stake is virtualized in this way, it's basically letting us
create a simulated universe that has its own laws of physics. And
that just gives the US as protocol developers a lot more freedom to
optimise the system around actually having all of the different
security properties that we want, right. And, you know, if he wants
it, the system to have a particular security guarantee, and then
like, often there is a way to modify the Emperor staking mechanism to
also achieve it. So it's just, you know, much more flexible and it
shows through and then the efficiency adds a the security of the
network. Awesome.</font></p>

Thanks, David. Thanks so much. I'm super honoured to be here. Thank
you all so much for having me. So as David mentioned, I write a song
a day. And in that capacity, because I'm a total nerd starting, like
last May in May of 2021. I just started like writing songs
documenting the transition that we are now that is now upon us. So
the first one I did was about VIP 1559. And I've written songs about
every single stage. And the song that we're about to hear now is the
final song in this series, because we're here now. And I got on a
call with Tim Bayko. And he sort of took me through that he told me
this. So there's the sort of story that ebbs and flows of how we got
here today. And that's what I tried to put into this song I wanted to
make like a little narrative about how how it felt to be a dev
working on this thing, and the highs and the lows and you know,
tuning out the noise and all that kind of stuff. So I'm super excited
to share with you it's called pandas are not known for running. And
again for the folks on Zoom if you want to watch you gotta watch on

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
next thing that we want to discuss is client diversity. Now this is
something that many people may have heard of already. It basically
describes the, the aspect that we have within Aetherium we have
multiple clients that can be run on the network. There is a bunch of
them on both execution layer and consensus layer side it is very
important to network health, decentralisation and security. So we're
going to have Pooja run us through you know why a client diversity
can be a problem and you know, when it's when it's and it's bad
state. And you know, how do we overcome that and what a good state
looks like to you, Pooja?</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Thank
you. Thank you, Anthony. Yes, climb diversity are another important
topic of consideration along with the upgrade of the existing climb
notes. I know we cannot just solve the issue next five minute, but I
would like to take a few minutes and maybe share my thoughts on the
topic would quickly like to share a presentation and walk us through?
Like, how do we can overcome the problem of client diversity. As on
the screen, you're seeing currently two charts one for the execution
clients and run for the consensus client. red yellow green charts are
generally self explanatory. But here, we see that red is mostly on
the execution side. Let's see why is it for proof of work we were
considering that the client adoption should not be over 50% to avoid
a 51% attack and everything else. So get it's certainly not in a very
good position. And there is another major reason for that is like if
there's anything goes wrong with get a bigger section of the client
may go down. But on the other side, if you can look into the
consensus client charter, you see the prism. It's not over 50% But
still it is in yellow, not in green. That's because when we come up
with the beacon chain or the consensus layer, the consensus is made
over are turning over two thirds of participation and two thirds of
voting. Here it is over 33%. And that's the reason why we have marked
it as yellow not in the green. Now that we are switching to proof of
steak today, the requirement has changed. And we will be seeing like,
why do we need client diversity? That is one of the biggest questions
that may come to everyone's mind when we are looking into these shot.
Probably we partially answered the most common question because we
know there are major points of having a diversified distribution of
clients for obvious reason, network security is one of the biggest
reason and there are other advantages of having this diversity when
we are testing any upgrade or testing any protocol to be launched. On
the main net, it has an identifying consensus bug. With the proof of
stake, there are other incentives associated with us taking and also
helps with finality. Definitely having multiple client options for
Node running is a strength of community. While eel clients diversity
looks worse on chart, which is and most of us may know that this has
not been the case forever. But at times when parity and open it
helium stop to their like they will not contribute any more, they
will only fear client options available for mining, I consider that
as one of the major reason for having more clients to work this side.
However, there were more clients coming up until now less
availability of proper documentation of clients can be one of the
reasons which may not be true as of now. And we are hoping that
things are not going to be the same, we will see a lot of changes
coming up. So be ready for the changes with the merge upgrade. Did
you know we have multiple options for you to run a client node. For
execution layer, we are having eight client nodes which will be
available post merge for you to pick up to run an Aetherium node. And
also on the consensus side. The number is no less it is six clients
available for you to pick up a Node running option or maybe become a
validator for Aetherium blockchain. If you were not aware of any of
the clients shared in the earlier slides, or you want to know more
about that, or maybe about your favourite clients feature what's
coming up, check out the new your client series that's on Eden cat
herders YouTube</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">you
probably have this question in the mind by now like how as an
individual or an institution, you can make a difference? Well, if you
are a solo staker or solo node runner, you will want to pick up a
client that suits your hardware requirements having an ELC l
combination that you think will be easier for Node running with
minimal setup. However, we do have support from the client team
available. And if you are a staking pool or representing a staking
pool, you must consider running more than one client. If running only
one client node then it is highly recommended to have it not the
major major client like the client which is having the largest
network share. I have added a couple of charts here for people's
reference like we can see when it comes to staking and when it comes
to rewarding and punishment as well. Slashing can be painful and
rewarding at the same time depending upon which side of the Node
running you are when you're running a majority client. And if
slashing happens, the pain metres show that's very high paying it is
very high. But if you are running a minority client, definitely you
are getting more reward. Similarly, the chart on the right side it
shows off some of the bigger pools and what combinations client
distribution they are having as well, this is amazing that we are
moving towards much and client diversity is definitely crucial. Join
us in building a resilient Aetherium Network.</font></p>

Drake is absolutely has become one of my favourite Aetherium

Drake  2:45:31  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
for sure. So, you know, at a high level, we're going to be reducing
the energy consumption of the whole world by roughly 0.2%. So a fan
right now is consuming 0.2% Of all the electricity that is produced,
Bitcoin is on the order of 0.5%. And I can't think of a single
technological innovation that reduces worldwide, you know,
electricity consumption, as much as the move to proof of steak does.
And one of the really cool things about this electricity reduction is
that the mainstream understands, it's something that's so obviously
good. You know, there's so many advantages to the merge. But things
like the security improvements, things like the military improvements
are much, much, much harder to understand. So I think, as a
community, we shouldn't be shy. And we should, we really should be
proud of this achievement that we've unlocked. And as Tim Baker said,
you know, it's not just about the 0.2% of all the electricity of the
world that we're consuming. It's also the fact that we can't scale as
a network, we want to become the settlement layer for the Internet of
value, we need to grow to trillions of dollars, to have very high
economic security and economic bandwidth. And we can't go consuming
2% 20% 50% of all the world's electricity produced. Now, the other
thing that I want to highlight in this discussion of electricity
consumption is that it's only one side of the coin. The other side of
the coin is the hardware. And this is always very much overlooked.
And you know, especially from Bitcoiners, who try and talk about the
the energy consumption being largely stranded energy green energy,
which may or may not be true, but we know for sure that the Asics the
hardware is not green, it's, it's usually hardware that depreciates
fairly fast, that is single use in the case of Bitcoin, and that ends
up in a dump. And building ASICs is very resource intensive,
especially the leading node ASICs, like three nanometer or five
nanometer that are used to build these, these pieces of hardware, it
consumes lots of water, etc. Now in the case of Ethereum, there's
millions of GPUs specifically there used to mine, somewhere between
two and 20 million. Basically, it depends on what type of GPU is
being used to mine. But what we should expect to happen is these
minutes GPUs to enter the market, and that to lead to a relief in the
price of GPUs, for gamers. So I guess it's good news all around.
Maybe except for for the miners.</font></p>

that is so great. Yeah, there are so many benefits that come from
this shift to proof of stake to so many stakeholders. I would like to
say, you know, no one's losing out. But you know, people who are GPU
mining, this is hard for them. And I hope they choose to join us with
proof of steak, but it's so beneficial to everyone else. Thanks,

you. Awesome. Well, the next topic, I think, is probably the most
important one, the reason we're all in Aetherium. decentralisation,
it is critical to Aetherium. It is what we're all about. And who
better to talk about it, then someone that I really respect in the
ecosystem. And that is all about decentralisation super fears
himself. So go ahead is take the floor.</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
so I'm really excited to talk about centralization. And I'm going to
talk really fast because I think we have about 10 minutes before the
merge itself and hopefully everybody's getting really excited. We're
looking forward to hearing from Danny as we go into the merge. But I
want to talk about something that is so incredibly important to our
entire network. And that is that we become and maintain our decision
decentralisation as a network. People have this idea that you need to
that we need to stake more coins on the theory of proof of stake
network. We don't actually need to stake more coins. That is not
something that that will inherently contribute to our success. But
what will contribute to our success are people who stake in
decentralised ways and that is solo staking from home. That is
identifying trustless open source decentralised staking pools and
staking with those. There's this, this concept of minimal
decentralisation being enough for Aetherium to succeed, but it's not.
We have to have credible decentralisation. That means that we are so
decentralised that nation states that corporations trust our network
enough to act on them. And if we rely on a few service providers to
stake our coins for us, then we don't have a decentralised network we
have. We have a tool that that maybe people are trying to extract
value from, but we don't have a valuable decentralised network. And
that's what we need to build for. If you want to stake with
Aetherium, I encourage you not to look for the cheapest way to stake.
And the reason is the cheapest way that you stake may erode the value
of the Ethereum network so that your coins are worth less in 10
years. But if you're staking in ways that bring value to the network,
like staking from home, you're actually bringing more value to your
own coins. And so I really believe that's a better investment for the
long term. I would love for everyone to check out each sunshine.com
it is a reflection of our current decentralisation. And you're going
to find there that it's not sunny. It's not perfect. We do have
weaknesses, but as a community Aetherium, identifies, embraces and
improves our weaknesses. And that's why I'm here because we know that
we can improve and we can do better. And I really hope you'll join me
in that that pursuit. So yeah, that is decentralisation. It's
something that I'm never going to stop talking about. And I hope
you'll join me in that struggle.</font></p>

thank you for yours for that. I know we're, we don't have much time

the next topic, it's actually getting down to the next topic is being
the merge itself, we are about eight minutes away, there are 3433
blocks and counting. And so we're going to have to actually pass it
to some of the experts in the room here, because we're getting down
to it. It's almost merge time. And for a lot of the people that like
don't know what's going on under the scene, once we emerge is going

going to vet this? What are we going to look at on the other side, so
I'm going to pass it off to Danny Ryan, to tell us what he is looking

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I
am I can I can do it all verbally. I know. I know. Right? Okay. So I
think we kind of got the gist, the proof of work chain exists, the
beacon chain is watching and waiting for this terminal number, at
which point, the first block on the proof of work chain that meets or
exceeds this number, the validator, say, Okay, I'm ready, and they
take over. And so at this point, you know, they're all watching,
they're all waiting, that is the point at which the first proof of
steak merged block will be built. So that's, that's kind of, I'm
gonna go through kind of the sequence of stuff that we we hope to see
the sequence of stuff that might be some some red flags, we might
start digging in that kind of stuff. So once you that first block
that the terminals have difficulty hit that first proof of stake
block, then that proof of stake mechanism not only builds blocks, but
validators send attestations. So these these little messages that
they say, This is what I see, this is what I see, this is the head of
the chain, you know, this is my view of reality. And so right after
we get that first block, we also start getting out to stations. And
so in each block at two stations from prior blocks, and prior slots
are included. So we hope to see over the course of the first epoch
which is 32 slots, which is about six minutes, we hope to see many
blocks optimally we'll see 32 You know, if we see 30 or more than
we're like, we're golden. If we see a bit of a precipitous drop
something like 25 in that range, we're gonna say, okay, something's
looking a little bit weird. We're gonna be digging in. But that's
going to be one of our first indicators is that first epoch? Do we
have many blocks? And do we have similar percentage of attestation.
So, you know, if we're 90 plus percent on the blocks and the other
stations in that range, we're going to be very happy. There's also
this thing each each block the sync committee, this is also an
indicator that similarly we want to see in that 90 plus percent
range. So after the merge block can happen anywhere inside of an
epoch. So we want to see the finishing of that epoch and then the
finishing of the next epoch. If we have over two thirds
participation, we're going to call that justified, right? And so if
we look at one of these panels, it says epoch and we see how
finalised happens and justified happens that we see pretty much you
see an epoch is is justified, then you see an epoch is finalised. So
after that like six to nine minutes, we're going to see if we have
two thirds participation, we're going to see it justified. And then
after the next epoch, we're going to see it finalised. So this
process is going to take anywhere from 12 to 18 minutes, depending on
where that terminal block lands. So let's see some of the other stuff
that in these panels that we might be looking for. So on some of the
dashboards, we're gonna see participation, we're gonna see kind of
the slots continue to increase, we really want to see these these
epochs increase, that consensus mechanism is going to switch from
proof of work proof of stake, ideally. And then we also watch logs.
So nodes, the implementation, the software, they spit out what what
they're seeing, you know, they pretty much say like, Hey, I got a new
block Hey, this that, you know, and it's not, it's not, it looks
complicated. It's too big scary at first. But you know, a lot of this
is just human language, it says ready for the merge and then says
terminal tool, difficulty, that kind of stuff. So rewatching logs,
and one of the exciting things is when you see that first block,
pretty much I think all the all the clients have a nice ASCII panda
artwork displayed. So that'll be kind of our first exciting
indication. We also watch block explorers, this is kind of a a visual
representation of the state of blogs of what's going on here. So this
you know, this beacon chain block explorer, this is an open source
explorers is really cool. We get to see live as blocks come in,
through this sequence. We also get a little bit of indication when
we're watching or watching the epochs justify so you get this nice
visual representation as well. So that's pretty much what I'm going
to be watching for, you know, really, we want to see some of these
really positive indicators and then we want to see that finality once
we see finalisation. We can take the breath breathe easy, then we'll
be monitoring you know obviously the next couple hours for next
couple weeks and honestly we're monitoring all the time. So I think
we're about two minutes till so I will turn it back over to you all</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
in proof of stake, we have this this notion of economic finality. In
proof of work technically, you can theoretically have reorg to any
depth, add economic finality and proof of stake to have a conflicting
chain that looks just as good you have to actually burn at least 1/3
of all the state capital, which is quite a bit of money these days.
And so really, what it does is it locks in these chain segments. So
at that block that becomes finalised and anything that came before
it, you won't have that reversion. And so, finalising the merge
transition is really kind of that symbol of like, you cannot revert
you know, it's it's the stamp, it's the the economic certification
that we're firmly in proof of stake.</font></p>

still have to make the make the tech actually, I guess, secure for

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
awesome. It's worth noting, you know, sometimes there's a need to
explain away or describe something that that wasn't optimal. But as
far as I'm aware, as far as I can tell from this stream, everything
was absolutely optimal. So that's just great. Like, I actually joked,
you know, it happened in the middle of the night, so we can fix it
before morning if we have to. But it's it's perfect, everything's
great. So this, this is it's time to wrap up our call. And so just to
summarise in two seconds, what has happened. We began this night a
couple hours ago as a proof of stake network with 1000s of people
around the world mining Aetherium with their GPUs, about five minutes
ago, while I'm sorry, actually, about 13 minutes ago, the entire
network shifted to proof of steak now relying on validators with 32
ether deposits to guarantee the network. And one of the biggest
benefits of that is the 99.98% power reduction. So that is our win.
That's why we're so excited, and so proud of everyone involved. So
that does wrap up our call. We're going to move into some closing
stuff now and I'd like to introduce Patricio worth halter. I hope on
your screen right now you're seeing the poet art Canvas for the past
couple of hours, pixel droppers, people in the community who hold
these proof of attendance protocol, pixels have been participating.
And that project is is led by Patricia Werth halter, and he has been
a tremendously positive influence in our community, supporting what
we do supporting, staking, supporting decentralisation. And welcome
Patricia, tell us what's on your mind today.</font></p>

plenty of stuff on my mind. This has been so long in the making. But
let's make this quick. So we wrap up nicely. We've done this
previously full combat. I don't think we ever had so many people. Not
only systems didn't crash, we created a pretty unique piece of art
impove we are creating an ecosystem for the preservation of memories.
And for many of us, this may be their most precious memory we will
create in a long time. I don't think anyone here now, we have
developed a way for anyone who has participated in Columbus to create
a time lapse of the reason they weren't painting. So then you can
have an NFT of whatever you were doing. While on the call. I was
talking to my very good friend and maybe calling him a fringe
fanatic. means travel. Romani storm, and I was helping Roman showing
the canvas, he's not much of a pull up fun and create his safe
tornato cash that you will get to see. And whenever we are able to
mean an NFT of the process of Roman placing pixels, that's going to
be an awesome piece of art. And last thing that nobody has mentioned,
this has been so long in the making, we have worked so hard that it
kind of feels like the end of the cycle. But that not only that's not
true, it is completely the opposite. This is the beginning of the
cycle, only now Aetherium has completed what was promised on the
first iteration. And now we have a strong grounds to get to where we
are to where we always want it to be. Coming up next, we are going to
have next explain how to get the most important part of these days,
which is having be here at this time. Next are you around?</font></p>

pole app is that we are doing a spam resistance mechanism with Co Op,
which is basically you're gonna send $10 Do you have this screen, I
can't see it. You're gonna send $10 to stateful dot eath. And this is
stateful dot eath is the protocol Guild and the hosts here, East acre
bank lists. Daily wire Aetherium cat herders chose this because it's
a really appropriate recipient of these funds. So the protocol guild
did not request this, we are forcing these funds on them. And the
protocol guild is a collective of 119 core Aetherium contributors.
And they maintain an on chain registry of members. And this allows
the community to help fund and incentivize long term core protocol
contributions. They also have a new NFT home of the heart out that
you can go and those proceeds also go to core contributors. So donate
$10 to stateful dot E. And that can be on any network and it's going
to be in di USD see, right? Is that it? Yeah. We can't sit. Do not
send</font></p>

 3:27:17  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">which
do you see having a higher impact on state distribution after the
merge liquid staking with distributed validators like rocket pool or
home staking?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">superphiz
 3:27:25  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Okay,
so home staking is the gold standard of staking. The more
decentralised the more stakers We can get in homes the more
decentralised and robust we are as a network. The second part of that
question was about distributed pools like rocket fuel rocket pool
actually acts as a decentralised pool because they have over 1400
node operators. And so it's a permissionless system. And anyone who
wants to run a rocket pool node can run the same as if they were
running a solo node. Now the flip side of that are distributed liquid
staking derivative products, those are far less desirable for the
protocol because they tend to centralise a lot of eath in a very
narrowly controlled environment. And so I think the best thing for
the protocol is to avoid distributed or concentrated liquid staking
derivatives and rather focus on liquid staking during derivatives
that continued decentralising the network rather than putting coins
in one place. We don't need a network where all of the coins are in
one place or in the hands of a few people. That is, that's false
decentralisation. And that's that would essentially be us being
dishonest with ourselves about the health of our network. Sorry, I
get that. That is my passionate topic. So thanks for alabanza that.</font></p>

I think just maybe more generally, in terms of future Ethereum
updates, protocols and sharding is definitely consensus layer heavy.
Folding sharding is like it is also consensus the layer but it's also
like very separate from the rest of the work. Then the Verge is
entirely execution layer, any like accounts abstraction EDM object
for me, I'd blah blah blah stuff is all execution layer. PPS is
probably somewhat weird mix of the two single solid finality is
entirely consensus wire. So I think realistically, it is going to be
like some 5050 between the two. Awesome, thank</font></p>

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
I mean, it is my obsession. Liquid staking tokens are fantastic. They
are a way for more people to get involved with the network. But what
we need to focus on is that these liquid staking tokens are being
good stewards of the network, that they're not just putting all of
the coins in one pot and further centralising. So what we need are
more staking protocols that operate in a permissionless way to allow
node operators to come online and further decentralise the stake.
Right now there is one provider that meets the standard. I really
look forward to seeing five or six of these providers, because we
need several different versions of this liquidity token to continue
decentralisation, what a lot of people will say is, if you have one
powerful liquidity token, then you can do so much more than defy with
it. But in fact, what you can do with that is centralise the network
and bring tail risk to the network and risk risk all of our success.
So in order for us to be really successful, we need multiple Liquid
staking protocols that are trustless decentralised and open source.
We need to steer away from liquid staking derivatives who are focused
on becoming as large as they can be because of the the concept that
that's more powerful in Defy. The goal of staking is not to promote
Defy. The goal of staking is to promote the security and the health
of the Aetherium network. You got to keep those two goals separate in
your mind. So</font></p>

one question that we did see that I can quickly answer is if we have
some eath one and hardware wallets like ledger, do we need to do any
type of updates? Will there still be eath? One and eath, two wallets.
You don't even need to do anything to update eath eath as eath you
don't have to do anything. The next question that we have like four
different versions of is what else is on the horizon for Aetherium?
That is as big as the merge. What are we looking forward to next?</font></p>

who wants to answer that one? I mean, the tablet if you're still on

<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Yeah,
sure. So I think just to go through the rest of the items on the so
on the protocol side, the buckets that I've split for the split
things between are the surge diverge, the purge and the splurge,
right? So the surge basically is sharding, right to the massive
increase in the de facto scalability over the network that will come
with the combination of the Ethereum network being able to process
much more transit data, because of Proterozoic sharding. And then
folding sharding. And roll ups being able to take advantage of that
data space to provide a very high level of scalability for lawyers
who roll up transactions. So that's a surge of a by the way, remember
the surge, the verge of the poor, the purge of this porridge, they're
not stages, right, these are all things that are happening in
parallel. So then the Verge is the switch to Merkle trees, which will
enable stateless clients, so it will be possible to be a validating
node with zero or close to zero hard drive usage. Well,
realistically, I think it'll be a bit more zero bullets, but
significantly less than than today. And it will enable things like
validating individual blocks and whatever order you want in whatever
order you get them in real ends. Really nice things like that. So
that's a lot of benefits from the from the verge, it will also just
make it much, much easier to be about to be a validator clients,
especially if you combine it with proposer builder separation stuff,
then the Purge is basically making the network more efficient by
removing the need for the entire Aetherium network to store like all
of the different parts of the history. And instead of like history
that's older than a certain amount of time will be shifted off to
kind of specialised either sub protocols or SR protocols. So this
will include like transaction history older than easier receipts
older than a year, even just responsibility for being able to
interpret Aetherium blocks that have older protocol versions, right.
So that are like more than one or two hard forks old. So that new
Aetherium clients don't have to support everything from Genesis and
they can be simpler. And then the splurge is like the big jumble of
everything else. So like to me the big items in there are EVM
improvements. You know, there's the EVM object for bad stuff. There's
EVM 3d for stuff. There is accounts abstraction and the whole roadmap
from there, there is a proposer builder separation, and then there's
a big long, kind of laundry list of smaller things. And then I guess
you can put this into the merge bucket, even though it's technically
not part of the bridge, but it's like a longer term proof of stake.
And that's a single swap finality. That's something that we've really
increased our priority of recently, just because we've been realising
the necessity for further ongoing improvements to the proof of stake
mechanism. So that will make our blocks finalised more quickly. It'll
make a bunch of things, hopefully simpler in the protocol and easier
to verify that everything is secure. So yeah, just a whole bunch of
different protocol layer improvements happening. And then at the same
time, I think the on the application layer, you know, with roll ups,
we're gonna solve scalability, I think we're also going to see a
whole bunch of privacy applications started coming over the next
couple of years. And we're know hopefully at the same time, we're
gonna see usability improve. So just all of the different parts of
the ecosystem are going to become more mature in a lot of ways. And
when I think it's gonna be great.</font></p>

I just wanted to have this wrap up with one last interesting story
about how it all began. Like, if I may invite McHale to share the
story of hybrid Casper FFG project and how this all mode started. I
think it would be a good point to wrap up the entire story much for
today's call.</font></p>

thanks. Bucha. Can you hear me by the way? Yeah. Great. Yeah, my name
is Mikhail, I'm with consensus r&amp;d. And, like two years and a
half ago, I have started to work on the merge project. It was like in
the beginning of 2020 When I joined consensus, but that time I like
deliberately Use this project to work on, like a. Yeah. And it's just
great to, you know, to look retrospectively to all these events. A
but One fun fact is that two years before I have started to work in
the merge, I have been involved almost accidentally in the hybrid
Casper F of QI project, we did a prototype of this approach to have a
finality gadget on top of the proof of work network. This is like the
first time where like I became familiar with Casper FFG, which is now
like main, the actually the BFT consensus mechanism that is used by
Beacon chain. And this time, it was like in early 2018. And by that
time, it was like the first the first time I met Daniel Ryan. So and
made this connection. Yeah, just want to share this excitement. And
yeah, and just given taking the moment to, to say thanks to everyone
to the community, to the community of developers users, and to the
Etherion maker to entire Terra Mecca system. Were given me a chance
to to make the history of blockchain technology and corrugated
congratulations on onto a almost an ideal, I would say it's just it
was just ideal transition. I didn't expect it would be so ideal.
Yeah, congrats everyone. was Rachel was</font></p>

went better than expected I was prepared. I was honestly prepared for

congratulations to all the client development team infrastructure
provided and network users, and also the community members. Welcome
to the merged word of Ethereum blockchain. And yeah, that's all from
our end. Thanks, everyone. Thanks all. Bye. Thanks, everybody.
